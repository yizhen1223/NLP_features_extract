Bullshit. """"His corkscrew senton finisher hasn't been called the Cancun Tornado"""". Why the fuck would you argue if you don't have your facts straight? Watch iDia de los Dangerous!, I guarantee you they name the move at least five times during the event. The fact that Ultimo Dragon uses the name for a different move doesn't matter. For example, in wrestling, for years and years, the name """"Last Call"""" was synonymous with a fallaway slam, but that didn't stop TNA from giving that SAME name to a superkick. Sometimes two different moves have the same name. The guys name is Human Tornado and apparently they thought that the move name Cancun Tornado fit his characters name, even though the move wasn't a corkscrew moonsault. PWG has named the move (multiple times) and therefore it should be in the article.

As for Mr.Wild, Well wildie she is not 1/4 this or 1/4 that, since when was this theory? Talk about sticking to the topic, You can look at the woman and see she is black! Her father is black! Her mother is part black! . Where is the complexity?? You want to get nitty gritty she mentions black 3 times and Puerto Rican once. That would make her 1/8th Puerto Rican if you want to go so far and that has nothing to do if it's black Puerto Rican lineage or otherwise.There's nothing complicated the only complication are you(zealot editors), who choose to use give blind allegiance to your clan members opinions  other than what is truth then turn around and hide under """"POV-pushing and much to-do over nothing."""" To get off topic a bit, Barack obama was a nigger, NOT nigga, but a Nigger up till Nov 4th or when it became apparent he was to become POTUS no.44. After that he then became mixed, then bi-racial then finally half white ,not half black mind you, but half white. Some person or persons feel very proud that this young lady has a trace of Puerto Rican lineage in her family tree and I have absolutely no objection with that naturally. But its just that,a trace, there is no need for a Puerto rican ascendancy with a link of Puerto Rican actresses and definitely no need to be stating Puerto Rican as a defining characteristic of her. It's trivial for she is far from being Puerto Rican both culturally and genetically. If anything there should be a native Amerindian link. Put the shoe on the other foot and this young lady was four shades lighter and possessed 1/8th African heritage and 'looked' Nordic. Would a link for African American actresses be up there? Would Black be mention first even if she had said it first??? You can bet your ass not! And you know it! I doubt it would even be mentioned. Matter of fact when I'm done here I'm heading over to the John Mccain page to kick up some dusk   for inclusion of his black ancestry, yes sir. And guess what else Mr.wild? I know just what you look like; WHITE. And you know what else Wildly? With your dismissive attitude I am even more certain than ever that you are very much a racist appeaser.

You seem to be arguing that wikipedia should categorize this article as """"mythology"""", because your source is that Encyclopedia Britannica categorizes """"Leviathan"""" as mythology.  The multiple logical fallacies here should be apparent.  Getting back on topic, there are numerous religious organizations with hundreds of millions of followers that teach the Tower of Babel was a historical event, and you are also arguing that their point of view should not be respected, beause apparently you think you have found some kind of superior knowledge to them to be able to state that it was not a historical event.   But wikipedia should be neutral, and should not use such biased and non-neutral language to take sides and declare any one scripture to be """"mythology"""", your own pov notwithstanding.  It must not take any stand whatsoever on whether it is historical or mythological, but should just present all the evidence and let readers make up their own mind instead of trying to make it up for them.  Your attempts to use wikipedia as a platform for pushing one pov against another are going to be resisted.  By the way, it might be more to the point if you can find an Encyclopedia that calls """"Tower of Babel"""" mythology, not Leviathan.

Jay's response to this lightness was to say, again and again, that I had """"strawmanned"""" him (while steadfastly refusing to clarify his point or show how I'd distorted it), then to attack me directly and personally and say I've never in the past shown the """"grace or honesty to admit"""" when I've lied about such matters, and so was unlikely to admit my deceptions in this instance.  And then began the beer-belching frat-boy hazing extravaganza you found so commendably charming.

 Stop being a power freak 

Hi Plumcouch,

Although you are not an administrator, you seem to be a self-styled Wikipedia policeman.  I don't understand why you have been going around giving people strict instructions on what to write and what not to write.  For the Aamir Khan and Vidya Balan pages, you insist on not having links to fansites.  I don't understand why.  If you want the power of an administrator, become an administrator.  Don't take the law into your own hands.

Administrators are not the law. Admins are normal users with more abilities. See here: []

Fan sites are a big problem. First of all, most of them violate copyright laws by displaying pictures which don't have proper copyright information and strictly, those pages are not allowed to display them. If anther page (like Wikipedia) links them, Wiki can get into trouble and with it the entire project. Also, if you add one fansite, you have to add them all. Wiki is no linkfarm and not there to improve people's traffic. Add content instead of links.

Regarding the Meera Jasmine page, you are exceptionally rigid about what belongs in the page and what does not.  You want a citation for everything, and you claim that a lot of the information is not relevant on the page.  Do you want us to say """"Meera Jasmine is an Indian actress"""", immediately put up a citation, scan a copy of her birth certificate and put it up there just to prove that she exists?

I don't doubt she's an actress. Google has various entries on her to prove that. If someone claims she's a devotee of Ganesha, movie xyz has been a mega-super successful film, it would be nice to add citations so you can identify such claims as not merely fangush or rumour which is very common on actor/actress pages. Lots of actor/actress sites don't have references and I admit that's still a big problem.

In the Filmography, I don't understand why you say the director and the co-star belongs in the movie's entry and not in Meera Jasmine's entry.  I'm sure you understand that the career of every actor or actress is shaped by the number of big names he/she works with, and it is a reflection of the actor's career.  So the info certainly belongs to the Meera Jasmine entry.

""""Big names"""" is a very controversial topic. What's big name? Is a big name still big compared to international directors/actors like Tom Cruise or Steven Spielberg? Furthermore there have been problems with citing co-stars and directors to show that actor xyz is """"greater"""" than actor abc. If you follow the edit history of actors Ajith and Joseph Vijay, you'll find a good example. In order to stop people and fans from these kind of edit wars, I think it's better to keep filmographies as simple as possible - else, things can easily be mistaken as fangush or hero glorification. Also, most actor/actress pages in the Indian Cinema Project have filmographies with just the roles and the movie - it was universally agreed upon and no one of the participants wanted to change that. If you insist upon changing the way articles at the Project should be written, you can make a formal proposal here: .

And why do you insist on creating links to pages that do not exist, such as the movie pages which do not exist?  If you insist on creating a link, you make sure the link points to something, and if a page does not exist, create the page first before pointing to it.

If you have a red link (one without an article behind it), people easily identify it as such and are generally more easily motivated to click on that link and create the article if they have seen the movies. Those red li",0

No, it wouldn't look the same because I would personally revert anything that was unsourced fancruft/speculation before it got a chance to get in and weave itself into the article. This is precisely what I've done on Tekken (2006 film), and whenever someone tries to add something unsourced I try to verify it myself, and if I can't, revert it goes (usually with a note asking for a source going to the editor).

 Sound of jewellery 

The sound of jewellery has played an enermous part in many stories, poems, and religious literature (more details and sources to come).
Different jewellery creates different sounds, ie plastic bangles create a high pitched clink sound, while others such as baxelite produce
a """"clunck"""" sound. Knowing how a particular piece of jewellery sounds can help someone identify whether or not a piece of jewellery is fake.
Indeed people have written about the sound of """"fake gold"""", and jewel makers such as Sharon Alouf, a famous jeweler have praised the high frequency pitched noise of gold bangles(most likely real gold she is wearing). To this day, the jeweler claims, """"the sound of bangles clinking together is very soothing to me. It always reminds me of motherhood.""""Alouf is even partial to particular tones. """"Gold produces my favorite sound,"""" she says, """"the pitch is higher and clearer, which I find energizing."""" """,0

 Heavily biased section named as Death on 18 August 1945 

The bias in the section named as Death on 18 August 1945, is very much conspicuous, very much unbecoming of Wikipedia. There is a literary effort to establish unconfirmed events in the veil of so-called """"scholarly opinion"""".  It appears the page is intentionally silent on the report of the last commission and the inquiry commission by Taiwan Government, the country in which the air crash was alleged to take place. It is another matter, but quite relevant, that Taiwan itself has denied this crash having ever taken place.  But what is most irritating is the last paragraph, where there is a emphasis on shock, disbelief at so-called death in India, which gives a lead into a suspicion that everything (even an Inquiry Commission report perhaps!) are all babies of this disbelief.  There are pictures like Renkoji temple, or newspapers reports published at that time which unsuccessfully try to uphold the the death theory, but keeping silent on the other theories, increases the suspicion of a using this page as a tool to publish own opinions rather than information.

My two cents

First of all, let me just say that I'm very happy Xandar is no longer blocked and I look forward to working together on improving the article in the next few days. This place just isn't the same without Xandar. 
On the substance of the criticism, I agree on some points, but disagree on the fundamentals. In particular, I'm rather shocked that Xandar suggests we should remove History, which is the most important section of the article. It's almost impossible to rationally justify such a reckless suggestion. The proposal to restore the old version is also very puzzling in light of the fact that it was a hopeless quagmire, as people repeatedly documented. I categorically reject these proposals by Xandar, but I'm willing to work on including some more material through summary style, which would mean greater coverage of topics that Xandar wants mentioned in the article while also keeping down the length.

It is broad in its coverage.

 Too much player info imo. This is about the stadia not the players
It follows the neutral point of view policy.
Fair representation without bias: 
 
It is stable.
No edit wars, etc.: 
 
It is illustrated by images, where possible and appropriate.

 Kiefer Wolfowitz 

If it's true that you have made the """"only if I'm allowed to bring a lighter."""" about Kiefer Wolfowitz (I have no interest whatsoever in going on IRC myself, but the reports that you said this seem reliable), then you are very lucky that this channel is technically off-wiki. Some """"jokes"""" are in such incredibly poor taste and so offensive that they are bound to get a very negative reaction when the subject hears them. 

From WP:NPA#Off-wiki attacks: """"Wikipedia cannot regulate behavior in media not under the control of the Wikimedia Foundation, but personal attacks made elsewhere create doubt about the good faith of an editor's on-wiki actions. Posting personal attacks or defamation off-Wikipedia is harmful to the community and to an editor's relationship with it, especially when such attacks take the form of violating an editor's privacy. Such attacks can be regarded as aggravating factors by administrators and are admissible evidence in the dispute-resolution process, including Arbitration cases.""""

And from Wikipedia:IRC#How is Wikipedia IRC related to Wikipedia?: """"When the channels are used to attack Wikipedians,[...] the resulting atmosphere is very damaging to the project's collaborative relationships.""""

Since the subject of your remark is not able to reply on the IRC channel, he made the wrong decision and replied on-wiki with an unacceptable but understandable reply. As could be predicted, he received a long block while you came of without even a warning (at least here, who knows what has been said on IRC or elsewhere), strengthening the belief that some editors have more rights than others and that admins are free to do as they please. To correct this a bit, I have unblocked him and issue this warning here. Further similar remarks, even when on IRC, will get you blocked for personal attacks.   """,0

Homosexuality in Ancient Greece

Do homosexuals like you get turned on at the thought that these great ancient people's may have accepted homosexuality? Why do you have to distort history to fit your image? 

first off there is no concrete evidence that alexander liked it up the butt...let's get that straight...no pun intended

second i'm sure there was gay shit back in the day, like in every culture...but i don't believe everyone was doing it....just because you find two pots out of a 1000 that show some gay act...doesn't mean everyone back then was gay

third...there is a difference between brotherly love and being gay or a pedophile...i say i love my friends and in greece i even kiss them on the cheek when i see them..that doesn't mean i want their ass...look at shaq and wade slapping each other's ass in basketball are you telling me they are gay?

fourth...just because some plays back in the day reffered to certain people being gay...doesn't mean they were...alot of plays (especially comedies) were made to be critical or make fun of people by dehumanizing them or making them look stupid...like calling them gay...just look at comedies now making fun of people...someone might say the president today is gay in a comedy skit, but we all know he is straight

fifth...i hate gay propaganda...i know they are people blah blah blah...but to try to impose on a great culture some of their values to justify their way of life is pathetic...just because there are no great gay people in history doesn't mean you have to ripout pieces of history to make your people look good....from alexander to hitler to lincoln...you guys try to change history or make things up to fit your own cause

i leave with quotes from two authors who wrote gay stuff on alexander

Some modern historians point out that the ancient sources cannot be considered definitive. Robin Lane Fox writes: """"Later gossip presumed that Bagoas was Alexanders lover. This is uncertain."""" [16] And, according to Mary Renault, who wrote a novel about the relationship of Alexander and Bagoas, """"No historian states plainly whether they were physical lovers."""" [17]

1c8f37fa17633e1b,"""Dear Mr. Kohl,
I was in touch with James Boros at the time of the """"Complexity Forum"""", and he communicated his dissatisfaction with the results in no uncertain terms.  Richard Barrett in a published interview alluded to this affair, believing the rejection of his article was owing to bias.  What is more, practically no major younger figures of the New Complexity were included among the published articles, whereas, for instance, Erik Ulman, who is a very fine composer but not a New Complexity composer, was included. Whatever the reasons for the choice of articles, the failure to include major younger figures associated with the New Complexity seriously skewed this entire """"Forum.""""

Secondly, I would beg you to not play childish games by removing composers I have posted. You have done fine work on Stockhausen, but you are by no means an expert on the subject of New Complexity. I have not seen a single article of yours focusing on this subject. I have never seen you at any of the festivals in which numerous works of younger composers associated with the New Complexity were performed, such as the bludenzer tage of the 1990's of the ZÃ¼richer Tage of the early 1990's.  Why would you dare to remove Wolfram Schurig, co-editor of the primary book series focused on the New Complexity, leader of the bludenzer tage in its most daring period, and composer commissioned by leading ensembles throughout Europe?  If you don't know anything about him, this reflects badly on your claim to be an expert in this field.  Why would you remove Klaus K. HÃ¼bler, whose influence on New Complexity composers is clearly stated in multiple articles in the New Music and Aesthetics in the 21st Century series. Marc AndrÃ© has received numerous prestigious awards and commissions, and his work has also been closely associated with New Complexity; one need only read his articles appearing in the New Music and Aesthetics series to find support for this assertion.

I would strongly suggest that you do your homework in this field before you go about arbitrarily altering the contributions of others.  You could begin by going through the first six volumes of the New Music and Aesthetics series, then read numerous articles in Musik & Ãsthetik (several references that appeared earlier in this entry have been removed) and works by Claus-Steffen Mahnkopf and others.  Then visit several dozen festival in Europe over an extended period. Then do some score study, perhaps beginning with the composers whose names you have removed.

ed480a9ec6e8a10b,"A classic BWilkins block, with all the familiar traits to experienced observers - brevity, arrogance and ultimately, ineffectiveness. In true BWilkins style though, someone else has to take his nonsense blocks to their inevitable conclusion . So take your bow Reaper Eternal, there's a good lad.

So here goes, BWilkins presumably blocked me because he thought I was about to OUT someone, yet in his incompetence failed to lock this page, so.....drum roll......User:Mo ainm used to be User:BigDunc, the account that 'retired' and never went back to editting the same articles, pulling the same stunts, or so the public record would have you believe.

Yes, that's the super secret information that the esteemed *arbitrator* Elen of the Roads thinks should be permanently stricken from the record, even though he's now the very conspicuous last man standing of a clique of Irish Republican editors who have been skewing Wikipedia articles for YEARS using the same despicable tactics, and are only now starting to be noticed by the sloths who work AE and be dealt with as appropriate (or 'retire' as they see the wriitng on the wall for their hard won 'reputations' as editors in 'good standing' who never got noticed by the dumbshits who are supposed to monitor editors for compliance with all policies, not just the easy ones).

Mo survives due in no small part to the fact that none of his mates ever had the good fortune of getting away with a mid-life secret change of identity, as well as the general cowardice of people like BWilkins, who usually run a mile rather than deal with something complex like GAMEing on Irish republican related articles. Nope, that's far too much like work for that lazy prick.

This change of identity is being covered up by Elen on the grounds of OUTing. Yes, that's right, Elen wants to stake her reputation on a patently ridiculous claim that knowing that Mo ainm is really a bloke called Duncan who lives in Ireland, is a violation of WP:OUTING, just to cover up the fact that she never bothered to verify whether this was 100% grade A bullshit before she started blocking people for calling it as such, those who were there at the beginning and know just exactly how this lucky cunt came to have this excuse land in his lap and save him from a complete FAIL in understanding what is and is not a CLEANSTART.

So here we are, with sponge brained morons like Reaper and detestible assholes like BWilkins continuing the farce with blocks and censures like this. So well done guys. Assuming neither of you has the backbone to do the necessary and end this farce once and for all by calling Elen out on her lies, one of you has to now ensure this post gets oversighted so she can continue this OUTing bullshit story of hers to cover her own incompetent deceitful ass. (ab)use of oversight is logged, so it's at least good to have more names added to the list of people who've enabled this bullshit for so long anyway, it was starting to look like a one woman crusade.

Both are organisations which form part of the wider 'EU' which is what we have written about in this article, not simply the definition in the treaty on european union. My primary consideration is to what extent any of these organisations are independent of the member states, not of each other.

I notice that the discussion above can't be modified, so, is it over? are they gonna leave this article as FIFA World Cup? This is really disappointing that a bunch of users are acting with this lack of common sense and respect for a name that is actually protected. Why are you guys doing it? In so many other articles on Wikipedia when something is well known it remains as the first article and above you place an other uses redirecting link. Why can't we do it here?. Imagine for a second a user goes online. This is an unschooled, uneducated user. Let say for the sake of argument he doesn't speak english as his first language, but his first language does not have a Wikipedia with +1000.000 articles. Let's say he wants o find out football soccer's World Cup. But he has no idea about the existence of FIFA, in fact he doesn't even know what it is, all he knows is that there is a worldwide known thing that takes place every four years where even the poorest person in this world knows about and that is World Cup. Now, this guy, goes online and he is in the db page, then he has to face a bunch of terms with additional terms. He doesn't know anything about FIFA, so how is he gonna know which one is the right one?? Now. This is an extreme example, but come on. If we know we have the power to making it easy on him, then why don't we? Why is it so hard to name an article the way it REALLY is. Look, if World Cup wasn't a protected name, I probably wouldn't care. If I had the slightest doubt about this , I wouldn't be so stuborn. But this is really wrong. Having a db page called World Cup is a big mistake. World Cup should at least redirect to FIFA World Cup and then it should have an other uses link. Please someone help me out here. Thanks",0

Speedy deletion of Kyle Landon

This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page that has been nominated for deletion (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

""""general discussion"""" or """"chatting"""" or a """"point of view"""".  It is a technically
precise set of rules, and in this case, a set of rules that demonstrate that
the foundation of the issue is a fraud.  THIS IS NOT OPINION, IT IS FACT, IT
IS RELEVANT TO THE ARTICLE, IT IS FOUNDATIONAL TO THE ARTICLE.  I AM TALKING
ABOUT IMPROVING THE ARTICLE BY CLARIFYING THE FOUNDATION ACCORDING TO THE
RULES OF ENGLISH GRAMMAR AS ANY LITERATE PERSON CAN SEE.  AND I AM TALKING
ABOUT ADDING THE RELEVANT AND FOUNDATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL CLAUSE.

FROM TALK GUIDELINES (why don't you review them!):

 There is reasonable allowance for speculation, suggestion, and personal
knowledge on talk pages, with a view to prompting further investigation.

 make the extra effort so that other people understand you. Being
friendly is a great help.

 It is always a good idea to explain your views; it is less helpful for you to
voice an opinion on something and not explain why you hold it.

 Article talk pages should be used to discuss ways to improve an article;

 Deal with facts

 The talk page can be used to """"park"""" material removed from the article due to
verification or other concerns, while references are sought or concerns
discussed.

 The talk page is particularly useful to talk about edits.

 New proposals for the article can be put forward for discussion
by other editors if you wish.

 Do not threaten people: For example, ...
having them banned for disagreeing with you.

 removing others' comments is sometimes allowed.
But you should ... stop if there is any objection.

As I previously posted here: THE ARTICLE SHOULD BE IMPROVED by making it clear
in the opening statement that the entire issue is a fraud upon the public
since there is no """"natural born citizen"""" requirement that is applicable today.
That is fundamental to an informative relevant foundation to the article, not
a matter of opinion, and a matter of grammatical fact.

If I say """"No animal except a mouse, or a rat, at the time I give the signal,
shall be captured"""", then I am saying only mice and rats shall be captured AT
THE TIME I GIVE THE SIGNAL.  My order has no validity at any other point in
time.  Similarly, the requirement for """"natural born citizen"""" only applied AT
THE TIME OF THE ADOPTION OF THIS CONSTITUTION.  It does not apply today, and
the following clause should be part of the article, since it is the clause at
the foundation of the issue in the article:

No person except a natural born Citizen, or a
Citizen of the United States, at the time of the
Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible
to the Office of President; neither shall any
person be eligible to that Office who shall not
have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and

I have been observing this dispute for some time and I must admit, until now only because it amused me.

Metta Bubble, I believe the problem here is that you started by advocating that user 66 be given a break and then repeatedly told him that as a result of his efforts, """"I believe this strategy will result in you getting blocked for being a dick.""""  I know you were probably trying to avoid making a personal judgment yourself, but by not making your views clear on this (i.e., 'I personally don't believe you are a dick'; or, 'I believe this would be the right thing to do') you made your views clear by omission.  It's really hard to blame user 66 for suddenly being upset with you.  Did not the Buddha say, """"When they meet a sorrowful man, they should lament the bitterness of this ever-changing world""""?  User 66 is clearly confused and sorrowful about Wiki and was hoping for more of a constant in his advocate.

CONTROVERSIAL?  What was is controversial regarding my listing?  There are facts Randy Campo was born in 1952 and was killed in 1992.  He was the brother of Jeanne Campo Potamkin and was the uncle of Jamin Potamkin.  There is a Randy Campo Lectureship at Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, the most recent taking place Thursday 17 June 2010.  The Randy V. Campo Lecture from June 2008 is on the Bascom Palmer intenet site.  You can hear what other unrelated doctors say regarding Randy there.  The first Randy Campo Lecture, which I attended was not videotaped, but I was there and heard the speaker state, """"Randy was the Michael Jordan of Retina surgeons.""""  Randy's colleagues honor him with an AMA credited lecture, guess if the AMA considers it worth a credit toward a medical degree to learn about Randy Campo by attending the RVC Lecture, Wikipedia should (or wikipedia's loyal vandals) allow the information to be on its site.  Crap it may be controversial to state that President Kennedy was killed in an automobile accident, it is true Kennedy was killed in an automobile, now the controversy may surround that a gunmen or gunmen also had some invovlment in the death of Kennedy, so should we remove reference to the facts and just state that """"Kennedy was killed in a car"""" on the Wikipedia site?

Your edit here was reverted by an automated bot that attempts to remove unwanted links and spam from Wikipedia. If you were trying to insert a good link, please accept my creator's apologies, but note that the external link you added or changed is on my list of links to remove and probably shouldn't be included in Wikipedia.

The external links I reverted were matching the following regex rule(s): rule: '[a-za-z][0-9]{2,}\.photobucket\.com/albums/.*\.jpg' . If the external link you inserted or changed was to a media file (e.g. an image or a sound or video file) on an external server, then note that linking to such files may be subject to Wikipedia's copyright policy and therefore probably should not be linked to.

""""Hindutva"""" as defined by Savarkar baguely means Indian nationalism that draws its 'inspiration' from Hindu/Maratha culture. It cant be called Hindu extremism is broadest sense, largely since Hindu fundamentalism is an oxymoron moreover, founding fathers of Hindutva were Agnostic Hindus. Hindutva rose as a complementary movement to Marathi cultural resurgence (all founders were Marathis (specifically Marathas and Konkanastha Brahmins and till 1970's most memebers of RSS were Marathis). Hindutva in these days is a vague ideology. It differs from one propounded by Savarkar to the one practised by 'parties' like Shiv Sena and Bajrang Dal.

BTW I was an active HSS member till about 2003, before i left Hindutva for good.

Here's my five cents: I do not think it is practical to give coords for a middle point of Routes. I have looked around a bit and the only place I happened to find such coords is in Bundesautobahn 2. In this example there is an important junction in a city near the centre, so it makes sense, but in some Routes like Route 10 which consist of 3 or more separate fragments, defining any """"central"""" point on them is too arbitrary. Also some routes are important and wide for a part of their length only, so their """"middle"""" is not anything to go by. I would be happy with 2 points, but I know this is not practical in searching. I think an important destination (city or big town) somewhere between 1/3 and 2/3 of their length should be picked. But cases like Route 10 need more coords, maybe inline.  Talk """,0

 I am not sure if I understand your reply above correctly:
 UNSD uses the term  """"statistics divisions""""  ( I agree, but the term refers to division(s) in the UN headquarter or agencies in different countries, NOT a specific way of geographic divisions of the world.)
 You still prefer previous title (i.e. """"United Nations statistical divisions"""") to the current one (i.e. """"United Nations geoscheme"""")?
If so, please allow me to repeat a bit on the following:
 The term """"Statistics Division""""(capitalized singular form) in the UN context refers to the organization of United Nations Statistics Division with the website at unstats.un.org.
 The term """"statistical divisions""""(plural form) can mean any categorization schemes, not just geographical ones. Google this: """"statistical divisions"""" site:un.org
 The term """"statistical divisions""""(plural form) can ALSO mean any organization bodies who are doing statisitcal work in governments.  Google this: """"statistical divisions"""" site:un.org
Therefore, it is not advisable to use the ambigous general term """"statistical divisions"""", or the wrong organization term  """"Statistics Division"""" to refer to UN M.49 . UN statistical divisions can refer to any agencies doing statisitcal work under the UN system, or imply that there are certain UN statistical categorization schemes in a general sense (not geographical). 

I agree that UN geoscheme is widely used for stastitcs and ALSO mapping. Natural Earth has region_un and subregion metadata for each country. I use it quiet often. It is why I notice that most of academic work refer this geographic categorization/classification scheme as """"UN geoscheme"""". Try Google BOOK search and you will find at least the following:
""""The best option to identify the states from Asia could be use the United Nations (UN) geoscheme for Asia. As per this, Asia is subdivided to four broad categories:....""""
""""The UN geoscheme defines the region as all states of mainland North America south of the United States; conversely, the European Union excludes Belize and Mexico from its definition of the region ....""""
""""Country groups are based on UN Geoscheme and World Bank regional classification.""""
""""...were grouped into regions and subregions based on the United Nations Geoscheme (http://unstats.un.org /unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm)""""
""""... that the United Nations Statistics Division would later classify as Eastern Asia, Southern Asia and Southeastern Asia according to its geoscheme. In fact ...""""

I also agree that many UN agencies (in fact, many other reports, consultancies, etc. have different """"statistical divisions"""" (in the general sense of categorization schemes) for research. This is exactly why I believe the term """"UN geoscheme"""" is better. Although it is NOT official term or a technical term (UN M.49), I have not yet found an ambigous use of the term. Correct me if I am wrong on this, so far every online and academic citations that I have found when the term  """"UN geoscheme"""" is used, it refers to exactly the regions and subregions as defined in UN M.49 . 

Moving forwards, since don't have the time nor will to take it to RM, and if you do not have any further couter-evidence or -arguments with the evidence and claims that I layed out above, I can help by making the necessary editing without going to RM. Of course, if you still have lingering concerns, please summarize your current arguments (preferrably after considering the evidence that I have already presented) and new evidence/citations here, before I bring it to RM.

GA review (see here for what the criteria are, and here for what they are not)
, I've completed a thorough and comprehensive review and re-review of your article, and I find that it meets the criteria outlined for passage to Good Article status. Prior to its passage, however, I have shared below some comments and questions that should first be addressed. It has been a privilege to review this article and I look forward to your feedback. Thanks!   (talk) 
It is reasonably well written.
a (prose, no copyvios, spelling and grammar):  b (MoS for lead, layout, word choice, fiction, and lists): 
 
It is factually accurate and verifiable.
a (reference section):  b (citations to reliable sources):  c (OR): 
 
It is broad in its coverage.
a (major aspects):  b (focused): 
 
It follows the neutral point of view policy.
Fair representation without bias: 
 
It is stable.
No edit wars, etc.: 
 
It is illustrated by images and other media, where possible and appropriate.
a (images are tagged and non-free content have fair use rationales):  b (appropriate use with suitable captions): 
 
Overall: 
Pass/Fail: 
 

Lede
 The image of the play's book cover is appropriately tagged with a """"Media data and Non-free use rationale"""" and a book cover copyright license. This is therefore acceptable for inclusion in this article. 
 The template is beautifully formatted and its contents are either cited in the template or in the article's prose.
 Per Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lead section, the lede is stands alone as a concise overview of the article. The lead defines the play, establishes context for the play, explains why the play is notable, and summarizes the most important points of the play.
 Blackrock should be bolded AND italicized in its first mention in the lede paragraph, as it is a formal title of a published work, like A Property of the Clan.
 The lede is otherwise well-written, consists of content that is adequately sourced and verifiable, and I have no further comments or questions for this section.

Plot
 This is a minor suggestion, but eleven can be rendered 11 here, which would make it consistent with 18th birthday and 15-year-old. 
 The three boys are arrested for the sexual assault, but not also for her murder? If they are also arrested for her murder, this should be stated here.
 Consider rephrasing as """"he grabbed a rock and struck her.""""
 I'd consider adding a comma in the natural pause following """"In the play's last scene...""""
 Also consider rephrasing as """"asks his cousin Cherie to throw [or dispose of] the vehicle's keys into ocean when she goes out surfing."""" Dump seems like a word to use when disposing of a larger item.
 This section is otherwise well-written and I have no further comments or questions for this section.

Development
 Newcastle should be wiki-linked to Newcastle, New South Wales here for those of us unfamiliar with NSW's second most populated area.
 """"Lee's family, who had learned of the play"""" would probably flow better.
 Freewheels is now italicized in the first paragraph of the """"Reception of A Property of the Clan"""" subsection. Since it is not italicized elsewhere, I would suggest making it consistent throughout the prose.

Sir,

It has come to my attention that despite taking advantage of our first-rate American education facilities, you insist upon identifying as a Bangladeshi.

My parents are/were Bangladeshis, and they were amongst the most wretched people I have ever had the misfortune of knowing; Indeed, during this unfortunate period of my life that I have been forced to spend in Bangladesh due to my father, I am now convinced that Bangladesh is the single most unworthy nation to exist. (I use are/were because, I regret to say, my mother was struck dead by Bangladesh - and despite her dysfunctional state and pathological lying, I mourn her loss greatly.)

Never have I felt more love for my country than now, when I find myself forced away from it! I have now given my loyalty, heart and soul, to the United States of America: The greatest country in the world, God bless every inch of it.

But after my experiences with Bangladeshis, I cannot allow for one such as yourself to leech off of the United States while offering nothing in return. I implore you to either renounce Bangladesh and enjoy the remainder of your life in the blessed free world, or get the fuck out of my country, you filthy ape.

Sincerely yours,

How to block this IP without blocking all of north New Jersey
Herby and ABF: Wikipedia found a way to block this IP range without blocking the entire range.  If you look at this thread on ANI, the message by Wknight tells you the range to block to at least make it more of a pain for the person to have to continually reset their modem until they find an open protocol.  I suggest we do that for about a month here.   

Whizkids Herby and ABF: apparently that does not work as I'm here, and I have been there, too.

David: if only you could stay off """"substances"""" for about a month (how long has it been since you've been without for a month, since you started?), and undergo psychiatric help in the same period, to start.

Hey Herby - it did work on WP - but if it doesn't, that IP range may not be as active on Commons as it is on WP, and so you may just want to block the whole range.

I'll agree that it does read slightly skewed from a neutral, fact-reporting point. Mainly in the language used, rather than any facts, however. One thing- the use of Taiwanese PCBs is specifically for the budget Vexter line, those products are not considered 'hand made' and are not hand painted as in the 'original' USA made pedals, still being made the same way.

Speedy deletion of ARCUMS
 A tag has been placed on ARCUMS, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section G11 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article seems to be blatant advertising which only promotes a company, product, group, service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become an encyclopedia article. Please read our the guidelines on spam as well as the Wikipedia:Business' FAQ for more information. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

WP:Avoiding common mistakes: """"Articles which are too short to have encyclopedic value. Articles must establish the context and notability of the subject. If an article does not contain enough content to classify it as a stub, then it may qualify for speedy deletion. Instead of creating a very short article, consider adding more content to the page before saving it, or using the  tag to indicate that the article is in the process of expansion.""""

Before that, a couple of suicide bombers blew scores of visitors to the Shrine of Bari Imam who is revered by both Shias and Sunnies.  Their sin?

In the Congressional meeting yesterday evidence was presented showing massive warming adjustments to surface data so that the whole 1940 to present warming could be explained by these warming adjustments alone. In sharp contrast, the global satellite temperature was stated by the majority of scientists to be the most credible scientifically. Moreover it is corroborated by the Meteorological balloon data. And independent evidence from growing Antarctic ice, that this year global sea ice is back to normal and even Greenland surface ice is growing strongly suggests that there is no current warming and that the surface data is corrupted either by these warming adjustments or by urban heating. Moreover the satellites are far more global than the surface data - and the increasing ice shows the areas they miss at the poles are not melting.

I would therefore propose that the present graph utilising the less scientifically valid surface data which is in no sense global nor accurate given the massive and judgemental adjustments should be removed and replaced with either UAH or RSS.",0

Hello, thank you for all your contributions! I make this message in good-faith. Please do not make hidden comments like this stating that an editor will be blocked if they remove a redirect. I am in no position to be asking this but I am saying this as it could turnaway new contributors (who aren't aware of the rules) feeling they have been bitten. In this case, I think a kind [user] talk page message would be more appropriate and effective. Also, you edit was reverted so I reverted it back to your version but also removed the block warning as it is not appropriate (no admin will/should block just because a user removed a redirect, specially if that hidden message was their only warning.) Feel free to correct me if wrong.Again, I write this in good faith. )  Cheers,  Huntley """,0

 Reverting for no reason 

I spent quite some time improving an article that was in a poor state.  Now two people have undone all my work with a click of a button.  You didn't have the courtesy to explain why you reverted it, but you still had the fucking cheek to accuse me of leaving an inaccurate edit summary.  No-one's that stupid so you were plainly just out to provoke me.  Well fucking well done, consider me fucking provoked.  I guess you didn't even bother to look at the changes before you put all that shit back.

GoodDay, the countries category is called just that, not 'Independant countries'. Wales, Scotland and England are countries (NI is not, but that's another matter). As they are countries they belong in the countries category, perfectly logically. In any case, this has been discussed repeatedly and the consensus is - as if we needed to be told! - that they are countries. Despite my opposition to the inclusion of the Six Counties - English Wikipedia has followed the political line of the New Labour UK government, a lie line which is contrary to the Belfast Agreement - I am tempted to agree with the compromise 'Category:Countries of the United Kingdom' but would like to hear other people's opinion as well. It's disappointing and somewhat surprising that such a significant change has attracted so little comment. Perhaps what we really need here in the long term is a clearer practical distinction between the terms 'country' and 'sovereign state'. BritishWatcher says above that he """"supported and accepted the fact England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland should be called countries"""" but opposes them """"appearing on lists of countries (where only sovereign states are listed)"""".

This section deals with events that precede the day of judgement and are outside the scope of the article, which is only a survey of the Muslim narrative of the Day of Judgement.

Regarding the piece of text """"Since most of those hadith are on the authority of Abu Huraira, most Shia dismiss them as a sad examples of what happens when all Sahaba are counted as trustworthy: A clear breach in Tawhid, the belief that God is above its creation.""""

Reasons for removal:

 Abu Huraira is one of the most prolific muhaddithin and a source of many of the sahih hadith. 

 The phrase """"most shia"""" does not cite any authority or text and could therefore be completely fabricated. Not to mention that there are over a dozen subsects among the shi`a.

 """"sad examples of what happens"""" <- that's a non-NPOV (non-Neutral Point Of View)

I have to disagree with you on several key issues. For example, the """"horse's mouth"""" is extremely likely to be biased in the horse's favor. If, for example, this local government had a reputation for corruption, or inefficiency, or waste, their own website and other government bodies' would be the last places to find references to that. Besides, primary sources cannot serve as an indication of notability. On the other hand, Wikipedia is independent, but it does not consider itself reliable.
The article's content is not really supported by the sources either, and I think at times it's simply wrong because you took too much poetic license. For example, """"beautiful ecosystems [...] valued by all British Columbians"""" - really? There's not a single person in British Columbia who doesn't value these ecosystem? So the article would have to be rewritten significantly to remove editorializing, personal opinions, hyperbole and the like.

And about the Priesmangoode design, what happened is Siemens original tender in the competition was the Velero, however it was given little interest due to lobbying by the Japanese with the E5 which at that point seemed like it would for sure become the winner. And Priestmangoode is only a designer so the need an actual manufacturing firm if they want their concept to come to life. They tried to interest other firms in Britain with the design but that didnt go anywhere. The Mexican transportaion secretary had already stated in the very beginging that a double decker system was preferable and since Siemens Velaro was pretty much already out of the compettition Siemens took back it's tender. Siemens then jointly (with priesmangoode) presented the concept to the Mexican transportation secretary that it could jointly manufacture the double decked Mercury design. But what really is the main aspect of why Siemens bid will probably win is because they are wiling to have the rolling stock fully manufactured in Mexico. This was in the July 2008 issue of Ferrocarril. In the end no real progress was really made in the final selection because then the Japanese and the French gave the same offer of manufacuring the trains in Mexico after Siemens came up with the concept so we still have to wait till 2011 to find out who wins / 69.235.193.67",0

faa8c48969b0d37f,""":In an interpreted language your source code is read in command by command by a software tool, which is called the Interpreter and executed.

What ? Command-by-command ? No interpreter is using such crappy technique nowadays. Taw

 From Interpreted Language/Talk 
 
some languages (like Perl) are compiled at runtime

Could you elaborate ? Taw

Every time a perl script is run, Perl compiles it and then runs the compiled code. At least, this is the usual way of using perl, although it's not the only way. Zundark, 2001 Dec 15

You mean compile to syntactic tree or compile to machine code ? Taw

 I believe it's compiled to bytecode, much like Java. As of perl 5.6 (version?), it's possible to produce a bytecode version of a perl program to save the compilation step. I think the bytecode can be converted back to full source as well, but I'm not as sure about that. Indigo Perl (http://www.indigoperl.com) produces a perl compiler that produces a machine executable, but I think the resulting executable consists of both the actual bytecode and enough of the perl engine to run the bytecode, so they tend to be rather large. Their advantage is being able to deploy the code to machines that don't necessarily have the Perl interpreter installed.  They have versions for both Windows and Unix-ish platforms.  Wesley

 Old Interpreted Language article 

An interpreted language is a type of programming language that is not compiled into machine code, but is interpreted at run-time by the computer, and translated into machine understandable code as required.

It is often a mistake to refer to a language as either """"interpreted"""" or """"compiled"""", because
most languages can be implemented in either way, and some languages
(like Perl) are compiled at
runtime but behave as if they were interpreted.
Other languages, like Java, may be partially compiled into an
intermediate form which is then interpreted (although that, too, might be compiled).
Some languages, though, are specifically designed to favor interpretation.

An example of an interpreted language is JavaScript.

Is Java interpreted, or what? 

The Java programming language article says:

""""The first implementations of the language used an interpreted virtual machine to achieve portability, and many implementations still do. These implementations produce programs that run more slowly than the fully-compiled programs created by the typical C++ compiler and some later Java language compilers, so the language suffered a reputation for producing slow programs. More recent implementations of the Java VM produce programs that run much faster, using multiple techniques.""""

The Java language is compiled, always.  It is designed as a compiled language, and is implemented as a compiled language.  It is often compiled into bytecode, which is then interpreted (with a virtual machine).  I think the Java language article is correct, but maybe it could be worded better.  LDC

Yes, and you can also compile Jave straight down to machine code if you like. The above claim that it is a mistake to differentiate between interpreted and compiled languages is IMHO incorrect; every language that has an """"eval"""" statement which lets you construct and evaluate statements on the fly can never be cleanly compiled down to machine code; you will always have to embed an interpreter in your compiled code. AxelBoldt

Way too much mess here has been caused by lack of clear definition of """"compiling"""".
It is used in two distinct meanings, as in:
 compiled to machine code (or assembly)
 compiled to byte code/parse tree/some other internal representation

I think it's wrong to call languages that use the second way """"compiled"""". In such case there would be virtually no interpreted language in use - no language uses line-by-line parsing nowadays, all """"compile"""" source to some form of internal representation.

Quote from FOLDOC:
     Compiler

     A program that converts another program
     from some {source language} (or {programming language}) to
     {machine language} (object code).  Some compilers output
     {assembly language} which is then converted to {machine
     language} by a separate {assembler}.

The photo I'm now using was given to me. The photographer sent me the original, full-size master and gave permission to do with it as I want. I am therefore the owner of the image. It's the same when you sell a photo to Getty Images: by agreeing to sell, you relinquish ownership and grant copyright to the purchaser.

I agree that Raven has has a lot to do with the sucess of this group. I really do. But I also think that keeping the girl in Walt Disney Records was a bad choice for a debut album. Walt Disney Records is obviously going to cath much mainstream attention, with the exception of the soundtracks of the CG movies and HSM.

I also think that adding another girl for the movie would be a good idea, but not to the group, unless it invloves a reality show. The show would catch some attention for the girls, even if it failed and could possibly boost them more than they even are.I also think that them opening an official MySpace page did something too. A lot of people access MySpace and they could attract more fans that way.

Also, I have been wondering if you noticed at all the Cheetah Sisters: Barcelona Mix on the Cheetah Girls 2 soundtrack. If you have a chance, listen to that song for me. It does not include Raven. It was re-recorded for this soundtrack. There are also rumors of a Greatest Hits album to be in the works after their Hollywod Records debut is avalible for some time. And since, they re-recorded Cheetah Sisters as an actual group, without Raven, I am asuming that if a Greatest Hits album does eventually come along, it will be full of re-recorded material that does not include Raven. If you also bought the Cheetah Girls Party's Just Begun Tour book, you will see that there is a photospread in there, and one of the pictures originally containted Raven.

Look on the main page for this group and find their picture. That image has been photoshopped. In that version, used to promote the tour and the soundtrack, they made it look as if they were all standing together originally. They weren't. Raven was standing in between of Adrienne and Sabrina. In the book, a picture from that same photoshoot was included and the lyrics to Strut replaced Raven's body.

I think that Hollywood Records is making it very clear that raven has nothing to do with The Cheetah Girls and probably never will again. I can also assume that the girls not want to have anything to do with her...well, they do not want to be tied to her. Raven has said that she is done with Disney after her """"Adventures in Babysitting"""" remake, since she does not want to be tied down to """"a kid franchise"""". I am assume that this upset Disney and now their are rumors of Raven being dropped from Hollywood Records and moved to Arista Records, which would explain the delay in her album release.

All I know is, Raven is not part of The Cheetah Girls. Galleria is.""",0

  List of United States Presidents by genealogical relationship deletion 

From glancing at your talk page, it seems most of your wikipedia contributions are deletions.  Is there any way I can access all of the information you removed?  (When you delete the page, it appears it also removes the 'history tab'.)  Anyways, I would appreciate accessing this information if you could help out.  Thanks in advanced.    

Nevermind my pervious request.  I have since found an archive of the page.  It would be helpful if you conformed to filing explanations for your deletions.  Please don't take this request personally; I am only asking that you be considerate, as you are deleting people's time and efforts.  I hope you have a happy holiday season and new year!

 Deletion of Glenorchy Air 

Why are you doing this?  You have deleted a page that has existed for many years with no apparent rationale.  Now I'm going to have to correct this.    

The article was proposed for deletion by another editor and remained uncontested for an entire week. The rationale was clearly given: """"Expired PROD, concern was: Notability has not been established, lacks significant coverage in secondary sources"""". Even with my attempt to look for reliable sources, there was hardly anything that established notability of the company. â xplicit 

What does it take to establish notability? In general all airlines are considered to be notable, See Wikipedia:WikiProject Aviation/Notability which says """"All airline companies"""".  But if you want to delete one you can delete Aspiring Air which is no longer in business.  When you put it back I can put a list of sources such as from the New York Times   

There's a general notability guideline that will show a general idea of what an article should contain. Since you plan to work on the article, I went ahead and restored it. I trust that you will add the sources you speak of to establish notability of this topic. â xplicit

Wrong licenses
I have corrected the licenses for the majority of the images you have uploaded. The exceptions are:
:Image:Wankhede Mumbai.jpg - On the flickr page the author has apparently agreed to license the image under one of the free Creative Commons licenses, but failed to actually change the licensing. 
:Image:Dhoom2.jpg - Concern that the creator is in no position to submit the image under a Creative Commons license, as it depicts a billboard for a film and copyright to it is held by somebody else than the photographer. As such, the photo may not be used on Wikipedia, except perhaps under fair use policy (which probably doesn't apply), or under panorama freedom (depending on what the copyright law of India says on this topic).
:Image:Bipasha.jpg - Image description page implies that it is licensed for non-commercial use only (contradicting your copyright tag); such a restriction is not acceptable on Wikipedia. In addition, the link to the original source (which could clarify which condition is correct) of the image is missing.
:Image:Bom.jpg - The link to the original source at flickr is missing; author uploads images to flickr as """"all rights reserved"""". 
:Image:Chowpatti.jpg - To verify that the image is indeed under the license you claim, the author should probably e-mail the Wikimedia Foundation and confirm that it is indeed under that license.
:Image:Hydmall.jpg - The flickr page states that it is under a Creative Commons No-Derivative license; a license that prohibits the image to be modified/used in derivative works is not acceptable on Wikipedia, either.
:Image:Infobangalore.jpg - No evidence of the image being under a free license.
:Image:Brigaderoad.jpg - Flickr page states """"all rights reserved"""".
:Image:Hoogly.jpg - The link to the original source at flickr is missing; author uploads images to flickr as """"all rights reserved"""".
:Image:Haf.jpg - Flickr page states """"all rights reserved"""".
:Image:Bangtemp.jpg - Creative Commons No-Derivative license.
:Image:Kolkahomes.jpg - All rights reserved.
:Image:Delhimall.jpg - Creative Commons Attribution Non-commercial No-derivative license (unacceptable on Wikipedia).
:Image:Yamun.jpg - All rights reserved.
:Image:Kolk.jpg - All rights reserved.
:Image:Myspalbang.jpg - All rights reserved.
:Image:Bangalore.jpg - The link to the original source is missing; no evidence that it is under the Creative Commons license.
:Image:Lalbagh.jpg - Taken from WikiTravel. Uploader ought to confirm that he is indeed under the author and that he has licensed it under the license indicated.
:Image:Nagpur.JPG - Who made this image?

There are several issues here. There are multiple Creative Commons licenses, not all of which are acceptable on Wikipedia. In particular, licenses that prohibit commercial use or making of derivative works are considered unfree and can't be used on Wikipedia, except as provided by the fair use policy; Creative Commons Atrribution, and Creative Commons Atrribution Sharealike licenses are okay. Also, there are multiple versions of the licenses; Creative Commons Atrribution Sharealike 1.0, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 are all distinct licenses. (The problem is that the upload dialogue only lists the 3.0 versions and not the earlier ones; when the image is under one of the older licenses, you ought to edit the image description page and correct the number. As far as I can see, Flickr only uses the 2.0 versions of the licenses.)

In addition, some of the Flickr authors have indicated that they allow the image to be used on Wikipedia, without making it clear that they release it under one of the acceptable licenses; a permission that only extends to Wikipedia is not sufficient, either. You should ask the authors to do one of the following:
Change the Flickr page to license the image under Creative Commons Attribution (or Attribution Sharealike) license (apparently, this would change the licensing for all images, and this may not be what they intend to do);
Post a message to the image page with a text similar to the following:
I, creator of the image, agree to license it under the Creative Commons Attribution license (link) [alternately: under the Creative Commons Attribution Sharealike license (link). This declaration overrides any statement to the contrary on this page.
E-mail the Wikimedia Foundation (permissions-en[AT]wikimedia[DOT]org) with a message similar to the above, also specifying which image (images) the user intends to release under the license. (This would be the best choice if the author doesn't want to reveal his identity on Wikip",0

ff51ba94ededd0a3,"""==Questionable punishment of D*98==
The January 2010 block against User:Darryl98 was extremely harsh, IMHO, as being a 1-month block for a WP:3RR violation that was escalated by a more-experienced user who was well aware of goading people into a revert-war. Perhaps an 8-day block would have been more fair, with an attempt to discuss the situation during those 8 days, and possibly remove the block sooner than 8 days, after true consensus (that means a mutual agreement). Please understand that Wikipedia policies are actually much more fair, in writing, than the way some users (and admin users) misapply those policies: the typical block for WP:3RR is only a 24-hour block, not 1 month. In fact, per WP:Blocking_policy, use of excessive blocking is a violation due to the reasoning that new users will become highly irritated by excessive punishment. The idea of fair punishment isn't just a matter of human decency, or common sense when trying to actually """"collaborate"""" with other users, no, much more than those reasons, fair punishment is a stated policy issue. I think what needs to be added, to avoid excessive punishment, is to develop a type of """"Code of Hammurabi"""" as a list of wiki-punishments for each situation, based on length of tenure, total edit-count, and repeat-offenses, so that the punishment does NOT just become a matter of """"lengthen the block so a user won't come back soon to cause more trouble"""". Meanwhile, rather than reducing future conflicts, excessive punishment poisons the Internet community with unhappy users who spread the word of how they were mistreated. Typically, users will not see unfairness as a few admins crossing the line and violating policies in a harsh manner, instead, a user victim is likely to """"blame Wikipedia"""" for being a """"bad system"""" that harrasses and abuses people. What needs to be emphasized, in discussions during a shorter block, is that some (many?) users (admins) violate policies, but this is not condoned, it's just hard to enforce because a banned user can return using a social-networking site that has thousands of IP addresses and Wikipedia cannot easily stop them. Also, Wikipedia has very limited appeal processes, and so there is nothing, yet, as sophisticated as even the """"American notion of justice"""" in Wikipedia: there are no trials by jury of informed peers (chosen at random). Instead, many issues are decided by """"dog pile"""" groups, who collect around a common bias or mindset, as a sort of """"feeding frenzy"""" or hive mind that sees a negative remark as a veiled attack against the hive, and many members of the hive must sink into """"sting mode"""" to counter-attack a person who states angry remarks. Currently, Wikipedia likes people who are ultra-mild and don't claim any Bill of Rights but simply beg to belong with the others. Hence, people from democratic republics come to Wikipedia and might demand their rights under the law, without realizing it is the Law of the Old West: be as nice as possible to avoid getting shot by other users/admins who are toting wiki-guns. Only some people think users have any rights to fair treatment, despite current WP policies that even require actions to be fair within those regulations. Perhaps WP needs to teach """"fairness classes"""" to users who come from fascist countries or domineering parents: being fair and courteous is not a strong force of nature, but rather must be taught to users. - 
Wikid, I'm sure that you are well aware of why WP cannot tolerate the improper use of WP:Sockpuppets. Just as your socking as Wz777 had to be stopped, so did PilgrimRose's socking as Darryl98. But blocks are not regarded as punishment, they are regarded as protection of WP from those who, like yourself, are having difficulty working within the rules. The indef block of a sockpuppet is applied equally to all such.  come howl 
 If you read that user's larger prior talk-page revisions, you will see that the stated preference was to become named as """"Darryl98"""" so I am respecting that request. In changing names, that user was not aware of how people can be goaded into a WP:3RR excess of revisions, and that escalation seemed to be the most serious of the policy violations. It is not a violation to have multiple usernames on Wikipedia. Plus, as an occasional user, it seemed that Darryl98 had spent extensive time to read the policies about WP:Sockpuppetry and properly explained each issue as it applied in the situation: no clear violation of puppets, but rather just being accused of """"nefarious"""" intentions, which was noted as a violation of WP:AGF. Again, the largest disturbance was engaging in a WP:3RR violation, typically risking a 24-hour block, wh",0

NPOV, Plagiarism, etc.

I have removed the following text chunk from the main article:

Sophie Calle is a disturbing character. Artist known as """"unclassable"""", its autobiographical works cause polemic. It is a photographer but almost never its photographs itself takes, it makes its life a work of art by using the others, and spaces it few days becomes a character of novel. Its most known series of photographs is that of the """"Blind men"""". By always combining the text and the image, it photographs blind men of birth and their request to express their vision of the beauty.  With the limit of the indiscretion, Sophie Calle often takes risks to work out her settings in scene. She follows people in the street to photograph them, she posed as a maid in a Venetian hotel to inspect and photograph the personal effects of customers. Works of Sophie Calle are diverse. The context in which the texts and photographs fit makes it possible to often qualify them """"artistic performance"""". The public is often shocked by Calle's works. Along with primary shock and disapproval, morals are often mandated to be discarded in appreciating the innovating works of Sophie Calle.

Judging from its terrible grammar, syntax and diction (and use of """"its"""" where """"her"""" should be, for example), this seems to be a machine translation from an unreferenced French source. Furthermore, statements such as the paragraph's initial sentence are ubsubstatiated and biased, and thus not encyclopaedic.   """,0

 Hoover's murder investigation re Kennedy 

The information about Hoover's role in the murder investigation of President Kennedy is well documented.

Hoover personally directed the investigation into the murder of President John F. Kennedy which is often called the """"Crime of the Century."""" The first citation in the Kennedy murder section of the article refers to a report by a congressional committee called the House Select Committee on Assassinations. It issued its report in 1979 after a three year investigation into the assassination of John Kennedy, Martin Luther King, and Robert Kennedy.   The report by the Congressional Committee was critical of the performance by the FBI as well as other agencies. 

The second citation in the section on the Kennedy murder is to the PBS Frontline news show. It was reviewing the official government records that âelectrifiedâ top Washington insiders and have been kept secret for over 40 years. These secret documents were obtained by the Assassination Records Review Board many years after they were sealed away from public disclosure. The once secret documents are fascinating, especially as reviewed by PBS.  

Hoover conferred with Nicholas Katzenbach of the Justice Department about how to approach an investigation of Kennedyâs murder. The former Attorney General was grilled by the HSCA 15 years later on why he was intent on convincing the public that neither a left wing conspiracy or a right wing conspiracy was involved in Kennedy's assassination. The copy of his memo is carried by Lancer.  If the reader wants the full version of the testimony by Katzenbach the reader should go to the House Committee Report. 
President Johnson, along with Hoover, also knew about the Oswald impersonator right away  that certainly tends to show a right wing conspiracy with an impersonator pretending to be Oswald trying to contact a """"hit man.""""   Maybe there would be another motive for impersonating Oswald trying to contact a hit man other than to frame him. I don't know what it would be. 

There is no question the FBI, under Hoover, acted as the primary investigative arm of the Warren Commission, and Hoover testified to the Commission as seen from these once secret transcripts of the Warren Commission hearing:
 I have been unable to find any scintilla of evidence showing any foreign conspiracy or any domestic conspiracy that culminated in the assassination of President Kennedy   The testimony is unsealed now.

There is no secret anymore about the FBI destruction of evidence. They were caught and its now public knowledge. There is a full pulic record. The agent involved even wrote a book about it.    

The American public does not believe the conclusions reached by the Warren Commission and believes the government has something to hide.  This is what the Assassination Records Review Board believes. 

 Conclusion

Therefore, any editors that think there are other reputable sources that have information please put it in. One should not simply delete well known and documented information just because one doesn't like it. If that were the criteria for deleting information, then Wikipedia would be at the mercy of every public relations firm in the country. Nothing """"negative"""" can be written about a public figure because his or her publicist may find it unpleasant and delete it claiming the information is a """"theory."""" No, the information is documented by reputable sources.

What I can't figure out is why Mr. Hoover's sexual life gets so much space, and yet someone doesn't want information on Hoover's job performance on the biggest case of Hoover's career.

re German Pigeon Club Links
G'day Mate, I guess what I'm trying to say by wanting them footnoted is that """"External links should not normally be used in the body of an article"""" as per that style guideline. Quite frankly it looks bad in an article when they are done like that. In my opinion I think it's better to select/adapt info from the website and link (footnote) to it in the reference section. Otherwise just add the links to the external link section. Actually that would probably be best for the German club main page link to just be added to external links. No need to have two active links in that particular paragraph. It does look terrible per WP:MOS it suggest  looks better. I'd be inclined to use (in German) however. So no ones doubting the veracity or anything like that mate -) Just trying to clean things up is all. So I'm suggesting now we just add the first link (VDT-online main page) to the external links section (delink the text in article) and footnote the second link to a reference section or otherwise use (in German) at the end of the sentence rather than linking the text. In my opinion that would look a whole lot better and fits the Wikipedia guidelines better.  Buzz Me... """,0

I'm in twothree minds over this proposal. As regards redlinks, on the one hand, over the last two years of monitoring the topic, I've seen it used as a catalyst and incubator for new articles; on the other hand, it is arguable that a death reported in a WP:RS is of a person of some note, if not necessarily within our standards. On the third hand, we do get some no-hopers on the face of it, which is why we tend to allow a month for an interested editor to create an article, and then delete undeveloped entries as non-notable. In the second case, we perhaps should not interpret lack of interest as lack of notability, because it may be that interested editors are lacking; that's why the month moratorium seems to exist, as far as I can tell. andemu """,0

Everybody: you're wrong. Everyone here except Bretonbanquet has said that they think that the numbering should continue on side two. This isn't about what anyone thinks; it's about reliable sources - in this case, the label of a vinyl record. It is also about reality - and as usual, people here are trying to make Wikipedia into an alternative universe rather than an encyclopedia. So, in a nutshell, it doesn't really matter what any of you think. If you can produce a copy of this or any album where the numbering on side two is continued from side one, rather than beginning again from track one, by all means, it should be noted in the article, because that would be an accurate representation of how the record was presented to the public, as well as a reliable source. Problem solved. By arbitrarily deciding on a numbering system that is contrary to what actually exists in the real world, you are using original research, which some people here tend to frown upon. As far as the problem of younger people not understanding the numbering: even today's young people are capable of working out the logic behind something with two different """"sides"""" being numbered differently. 

I also don't agree that the sides should be eliminated completely; an album article is supposed to reflect the reality of the initial release, which, for most of the best music ever recorded, is vinyl. It is our responsibility to convey that reality accurately, not to revise it.  â¢talkâ¢   """,0

""""Controversy exists about the branding of Arborsculpture as none of the practitioners he presents in his book (""""Arborsculpture Solutions for a small planet"""") use the methods as described in the books, accept the term, or agree to be tagged by it.""""

This wiki page is not about the book Arborsculpture or the about author. The statement is a lie as several of the subjects in the book do use the word. Herman Block who was in the book uses the chair making techniques as described in the book. If someone resurrects a lie that was edited out long ago it's the same as writing the lie themselves. 
But I'll accept this: 
""""Controversy exists about the naming or branding of the art form as Arborsculpture""""

 This page should not be used as a way to slap down the competition when someone has a new book coming out on the same subject.
Blackash is pooktre and has a conflict of interest, a new book coming out and needs to sign with 4 tildes so we can track what they do on wikipedia.  There were some good historical photos on the page but these have been replaced with error notices, this is very close to vandalism. The methods described on the page are general enough and do reflect the methods used to create the trees in the historical photos shown. The historical photos should be returned. 

I don't think Portmanteau is accurate, """"conjunction"""" is better.

I think the following should be removed.
 """"Richard Reames was inspired by the works of Axel Erlandson to attempt his first experiments with growing trees in chairs, which lead him to writing his first book """"How to grow a chair"""" before his experiments were mature.""""
While this is true, this Wiki page is about the word Arborsculpture, it is not about Richard Reames or his books.

Speedy deletion of Cliff Akurang
 A tag has been placed on Cliff Akurang requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

Are you talking to me, or the 300+ people who've downloaded this refutation of you and your uncivil friends?: http://www.mininova.org/tor/1264745

JoshuaZ said:

""""Starfire, as I tried to explain to you Wikipedia cares about reliable sources and verifiability, not truth. Now, if you read that guideline, you may understand why in general AIG and many of the other sources you used are not reliable sources.""""

Hey JoshuaZ the liar, where does Wikipedia's policy say that AnswersInGensis.org is not a reliable source? Where JoshuaZ the vandal and liar? Show us. So you think saying, """"Now"""" is scientific evidence that you are a wise and intelligent teller of the truth or that you know what a reliable and verifiable source is?

JoshuaZ, where does Wikipedia's policy say that the Jacob Sheep Association = a reliable and verifiable source that Jacob Sheep are biologically primitive you hypocrite? Explain that hypocrite who personally attacked Starfire777 using lies.

Show your references JoshuaZ. Saying, """"Now"""" is not a reference that your accusations are true are they? Why can't you make sense Joshua?

Again, where did those verses prophecy anything? Do these look like prophecies JoshuaZ?:

Joshua also said:

""""In this case, they did have sources, so you have even less of an argument.""""

Wrong JoshuaZ. Simply citing sources as you yourself said does not make the source valid. It must be substantiated and verifiable. Why do you conveniently forget that you smug babbling hypocrite?

Your later comments don't merit much of a response, but I wThen he said:

""""ill simply note that accusing people of bigotry, bias, hypocrisy, irrationality and trolling makes my earlier comment about not using """"Darwinist"""" as a slur somewhat irrelevant;""""

Because you said so JoshuaZ, and whatever you said is true is true because you said so. So much for references eh? All you have to do is accuse and it makes you right, right hypocrite? See how you go round and round in circles using circular reasoning?

""""if your earlier comment toed the line, the one above crosses it.""""

Because you said so JoshuaZ, and whatever you say is true because you said so. Science!

""""I suggest you calm down""""

I suggest you not use sarcastic insults like that, ok hypocrite? You're implying that the Starfire777 is ill-tempered merely because he points out that you are hypocrite and uses logic to do so (as well as verifiable references on Answersingenesis.com which you lied about not being reliable and being against Wikipedia's rules to cite), ok liar?

I suggest you also not command a Christian to follow your moral standards over Christ's, over God's. He is a Christian don't ya know? Are you now God to tell him how to feel and think? I suggest you read this verse and take it to heart which millions of Christians know very well so that you learn how not to offend them again:

""""Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, and give no opportunity to the devil."""" - Ephesians 4:26-27

Last time I checked JoshuaZ, neither your nor Wikipedia's rules superceded God's. 

""""and read the relevant Wikipedia policies and guidelines while you wait for your block to expire.""""

Oh the old """"you need to read it but I don't"""" and """"you sit and think while your grounded young man"""" insults. What an arrogant, childish hypocrite you are.

I suggest that you stop pretending that whatever you say is true merely because you said it, and again, learn what Starfire777 properly told you to learn.

I'll enhance the list for you:

Reference, evidence, truth, reality, lie, bigot, hypocrite, fallacy, circular reasoning, troll, stalking, harassment, insults, hatred, and love.

And Joshua also said:

""""This is in addition to issues of original research in regard to Biblical prophecies and other issues on the Charles Darwin page.""""

Wow you sure like to weasel-word: """"other issues""""? What are you references for this vague """"other issues"""" JoshuaZ the Policy Master of Wikpedia?

And Joshua, who said anything about prophecies? Where did Starfire777 say anothing about prophecies? No JoshuaZ the wannabe scholar, he said """"predicted"""" in the same way that science can be used to predict the outcome of an experiment. If your lazy-brained truth-careless self had been paying attention to what he said CARE FULL Y you might have noticed that the verses were using PAST TENSE JOSHUA, not FUTURE TENSE JOSHUA.

 I understand your point. I will have to agree with you on renaming as well. From what I understand, it would be similar to what Current main Luftwaffe article has.

   So How are we to go about getting this done ? As it is, all 3 articles have sufficient referenced information on their own. All we need is to put it together in a coherent fashion. 

P.S. I am sorry I was not able to see Archive section. I could only see the Page history.

The band promotes Croatian patriotism and ultra-nationalism, and sings about topics such as the love for one's country, family and religion, but also about the hatred of Serbs and Croatian social democrats. Dealing with such topics has made the band controversial. PerkoviÄ has been known to openly promote UstaÅ¡a ideology because he wears black clothes, salutes in the corresponding way and had often openly supported the UstaÅ¡e and the NDH in his statements to the media. 

Ultra-nationalism?Ultra-nationalism means that you want to destroy everything that is not of your nation.While patriotism means that you love your own nation,but you respect others.Where in his songs does he promote hate to other nations?And no mentioning songs created in time of war against the Serbs,because it was the time of war.And only mention songs written by him.Not what he is accused of performing.

 Hatred toward SDP?Where?Name source.He is right wing,that si widely known.Of course he disagrees with their politics and he considers their politics bad for Croatia,but hatred? Reliable source please.

Where does he promote openly Ustashe?Citation please.Because he wears black clothes?Are all rockers Ustashe?By this,rock 'n' roll is equal fascism.He is a rock singer,of course he wears black clothes.
Salute he uses is an old salute of Croatian nobles,that existed long before Ustashe.

Despite this, his statements confirming his support for the UstaÅ¡e actually outnumber his denouncements of this virtual NSDAP equivalent (he is noted to have publicly voiced his support for the NDH, in various degrees, to the media on at least twenty occasions). His credibility in these statements is diminished not only by this fact but also by the legal necessity to denounce any fascist movement in order to avoid further banning (or other legal action).

Again,I see that this is already discussed.Feral is not reliable,its a tabloid.Only reliable newspapers should be used.And these quotations in Feral,while they may be true,there are no links to check the meaning,because they may be taken out of contest,and they could have totally fifferent meaning ii their original contest.This is not reliable.

And one more question.A couple of months ago I translated two Perkovic's statements in Jutarnji list and Vecernji list.I've put relevant sources,links to that articles.And a picture was there also.Someone deleted all this without giving explanation on the discussion page.This is not what wikipedia is about.Any change must be explained.Shame on anyone who uses this kind of sneaky methods.",1

Thank you for taking the time to take a look at our page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Cotter_(My_Ex-Wifes_Wedding_Dress)

We are not trying to create spam or blatant advertising. We are simply trying to add to the valuable content of wikipedia.

Kevin Cotter has become well known for his blog http://myexwifesweddingdress.com/ and is now having his book published. The many references from media sites like the Today Show and the Huffington Post should show why this article should be included in wikipedia.

I thought that putting the blog name in the title would be helpful for people looking for him or his blog instead of spammy, maybe i should create another page for his popular blog.

8f2bc002c8e07080,"Dear few wiki editors who claim now to own wiki
When these things become personal they can become petty. I donât believe you have the competence to authorize a lifetime ban on another wiki editor ie another human being. Wiki doesnât work that way. Neither do computers. You might approve of the techniques of third world dictatorships. But youâll find it hard to enforce that kind of censorship on any part of the internet that isnât entirely your own. Unless one of you is the wiki founder in which case you changed your tune mate not giving you any more donations.
I was informed of the recent spate of death threats against Sharmila via a Mumbai Activist who received a message from a Manipuri who didnât want to be named. I asked for 24 hours grace from wiki on exceptional grounds because the threats were made only because the Authorities believe they can control media coverage of what they do. What the Nazis told the Jews they murdered in the death camps was that no one would ever know what would happen to them, that when they were all dead they would turn the camps into gardens. Even the memory of their existence would be expunged. Yes in that I am comparing you to a bunch of Nazis. I donât know how the story broke only that wiki had nothing to do with it.
 On 7th November at her fortnightly judicial remand hearing a reporter for a national Indian Television News Channel managed an 11 minute interview with Sharmila. You may be aware even if a reporter has a documented story they require multiple confirmations, sort of like wiki but these people have a broad and deep background knowledge of the culture politics history and current events around the topic. Wiki editors blindly follow protocols and then mix that with prejudice and uninformed reasoning often removing important disclosures because they lack any qualifications or experience to judge what matters. 
The page on Irom Sharmila has shrunk over the past two years because of the moronic conduct of a few over aggressive editors with too much time who race about different articles expunging data based on idiosyncratic nonsense. Content makes no difference to them whether they are editing articles on UFO sightings, the history of double entry bookkeeping or Irom Sharmila. 
Some examples are one editor decided loads of people are nominated for the long list of the Nobel Prize so he removed her nomination based on his opinion that long list nominations are not noteworthy. Hundreds of people are nominated every year for the long list. But there are now 7 billion people on this planet and I donât believe any wiki editor has ever received a nomination or personally knows anyone who has. The short list is not published so wiki editors could argue itâs pure speculation. However informed opinion is published yearly by several respected organizations I believe one is called the Olaf trust (google is very helpful try it). For at least two consecutive years they have posited Sharmila as a possible on the short list which is always a single figure guess. Wiki editors have removed most of the smaller prizes offered to Sharmila because they didnât like the Indian sounding names of the awards but they were fully referenced. Similarly they have removed at least one puppet production and two dance theatre productions about her. The graffiti image of her from Mumbhai is iconic. But because it wasnât done by Banksy the snobbery of western wiki editors had it expunged. These people never use their real names and are bringing the concept of a free and open knowledge database into disrepute by the bullying and intimidation of anyone who disagrees with their nasty tactics in the case of this article. 
Unless other wiki editors stand up to these petty racists who know nothing about India Manipur or Irom Sharmila yet pontificate on what can be posted here and now claim absolute power to remove any other editor who disagrees with them wiki is already dead. Hundreds will come to the article to learn more about Sharmila having read something somewhere and all will now leave disappointed because it adds nothing. The prime wiki editor of a peopleâs encylopaedia is people. The downside of giving the unqualified this sort of power is you reduce the quality and content of articles when ignorant bigot gangs take up personal vendettas. I presume the hope was you would only edit articles you where you had some knowledge of the subject. But some feel that they have now become professionalized wiki editors although they donât need any outside reference to qualify them as experts.
But back to the last key event that wiki will not allow to be noted along with many others. Usually before an interview the press are cautioned not to report any criticism of the Government of Manipur otherwise the privilege given to them will be removed. Thereâs an unspoken threat also that scribes have low life expectancy in Manipur. Manipur is like Sri Lanka only",0

Hi Pigsonthewing,

As someone who has been silently observing your behaviour over the past few months on Wikipedia, I am worried by what I perceive to be a downward spiral of petty fighting, vindictiveness, childishness and bad faith on your part. It seems that you've lost the joy in editing Wikipedia, and now you do as some sort of way of making yourself feel better at the expense of others. What a small, small man you are. Grow up! Get a life! Find yourself a girl to have sex with or something, because the way you've been sliding downhill is bringing everyone else at this fine institution down. I'm here to create an encyclopedia. You seem to be here to fight with other people and cause disruptions. You're making everyone else's life harder. Please stop that; just go away.

i remember you from the discussion about the whitecaps and not wanting them to have a new page for their MLS entity.  you don't know jack about MLS and therefore you do not get the last say about how an MLS page is updated.  these games are officially broadcast by the league itself and the numbers are being worn and are clearly visible and assigned to players that official league announcer are referring to  .... so obviously they are going by some sort of officially published rosters.  the impact website is NOT the only way to have valid information.  if and when the website is updated and any numbers differ they can be changed at that time.  your insisting that my own f**king eyes are not a good enough validation nor is the OFFICIAL league broadcast/ers is completely idiotic and pedantic.  there is no problem erring on the side of more information being available on wikipedia especially since it was information that was out there to be gathered and put on wikipedia in the first place.  it isn't like the information is made up ... it comes from a reliable source ... the league itself ... it just so happens i was the only one dedicated enough to watch the game and compile the numbers and you were too lazy to do so.",1

In an attempt to steal Flash's speed, it is Kid Flash who loses his powers.  To help out, Green Lantern creates a temporary Power Ring for Wally to use, dubbing him Kid Lantern (With a costume, identical to Hal's.  Wally's head piece resembles his Kid Flash uniform).

1759dd43adc14b68,"Hi Eric, no. You are not in any way one of the people I was talking about. You just got caught in the crossfire, and if I made you think I was thinking of you I apologise. Your work is consistent good plus even more importantly, you have a sensitivity to other people's work with a few people don't. You build on their work to produce something that improves in quality. The people I was talking about arrive at an article, chop it around, change meanings, change context, spelling, capitalisation and then move on, more often than not without giving the slightest suggestion that they actually knew what they were doing. 

For example, one guy when he comes across the word taoisigh which is the gaelic plural for taoiseach and which is explained as such on its first mention in some articles, frequently changes it to taoiseachs, a non-existent word. He has tried to change governors-general to governor-generals, Prime Minister to Prime minister. He changed links from President of Ireland to President of Ireland, links to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (ie the form of UK between 1901 and 1922) to United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, so linking the reference to the wrong UK. He mucked up some links to TÃ¡naiste (deputy Irish prime minister) by lower-casing it, changed a series of mentions of First Lady when referring to a specific first lady to lowercase first lady, changed one mention of Garret FitzGerald to Garrett Fitzgerald, removed the word Ãg from GearÃ³id Og Fitzgerald and MÃ³r from GearÃ³id MÃ³r Fitzgerald, not grasping that they actually were two different people (MÃ³r = big in gaelic and indicated the father, Ãg meaning small meant his son) and ended up turning an article that mentioned them both into gobbledigook. That is just some of my work he has mucked up. He made a complete mess of some biology articles, reduced an article on mediÃ¦val history to such a degree of unreadability that the author, one of the world's top mediÃ¦val historians, quick wiki in disgust. I know at least six people who have left wiki over his actions. And there are quite a few such people. Not a lot, but enough to mangle everything they touch. Another contributor constantly changed an elementary fact in 18th century history on the basis of google searches. I checked on google. The majority of articles said he was right. Those google searches turned up stuff that were barely of high school standard. But she treated google as sacrosanct. If a google search said it, it was gospel. 

I have had political science articles which I have written and which were based on hard fact, in mediocre garbage, applying wrong capitalisation (again based on google searches that largely threw up high school essays), wrong spelling, wrong interpretation, etc. I wasn't reacting simply to the Droop Quota at all (that was the sixth article that day I had done that had been 'hit'. In that case Michael Hardy as he is prone to do, swept in to a topic he knows little about, changed capitalisation, text and even the formula which is the standard DQ formula taught (in that form because as already happened in the discussion on the talk page, if you leave out the parentheses people muck up the order of the calculation and so get the wrong formula). That intervention was classic Michael; go onto a page about a topic he doesn't know much about and instead of asking why it is written like that, unilaterally change it, in most cases producing a version that is so wrong it would be savaged if any student repeated it in a class.

American english and British English use different approaches to capitalisation. Many of the references were to things only found outside the US and so capitalised. Instead he insisted on applying US capitalisation rules to things whose capitalisation is a result of their existence and usage in parts of the world outside the US. That indeed is one of the reasons why google should never be used in checking capitalisation. Apart from its general unreliability, most website mentions in the US are created by people who automatically and incorrectly apply US capitalisation to things that don't exist in the US and are capitalised internationally. A classic example is the electoral system PR.STV (Proportional Representation using the Single Transferable Vote). Michael insisted on lowercasing it on the basis on a google search. PR.STV isn't used in the US and is generally capitalised when referring to the specific voting system, and lowercased when used generically. Where it is mentioned on google, it is largely on the basis of Americans writing about it and downcasing it to suit American english. So Michael unilaterally mucked up the capitalisation, then another US user moved the page to another name that refers to a somewhat similar but not the same electoral system more widely known in the US. So any non-American user would get r",0

The hardest-working, most experienced, most involved critic of this article has misgivings about mediation. Let's start now.
Is the CMT fringe?
If a consensus is reached to the effect this is a fringe theory, the article will need to make that clear in a way that is neutral. Once. Not over and over again in every nook and cranny. Sly, underhanded discredits like the top link in """"See also"""" being to Bible conspiracy theory make you (whoever put it there) appear to be sleazy and contemptible. It gives the impression that you play dirty, that the quality of your argument against the theory is so weak you need to apply Fox News persuasion techniques. I'm sure none of that is the case. But that's the impression it gives. 

And the word fringe need not be used. The word in general parlance carries a derogatory implication (marginalized and nutty), whereas the way we use it, fringe theory is """"not mainstream"""". Something like """"the theory is not widely accepted by mainstream theologians and historians"""" conveys it's place in the field without stooping to derision.

Personally, judging only on the quotes provided by Eugene in the FAQ, which are opponents speaking, but includes one proponent (I think - did I delete him?) who concedes the view is considered eccentric, and in the absence of any counter evidence, I have no choice but to conclude it is a fringe theory.

 if you are going to make large changes on controversial articles it is, as you say, necessary to discuss them and come to a concensus.  No such thing happened with Zeno's edits and for lack of time I reverted to the less horrible version.""""  

, it's not true that I have not discussed my edits. Nor have I made a large change to the article - I have concentrating on one sub-section of the article, and I have concentrated on a small number of facts regarding the treatment of POWs: i.e. the facts that they may be executed, enslaved for labor or sex, ransomed, or freed. These four options in Islamic law concerning POWs are well-known amongst academics and scholars, as my sources have proven. So my edits have not been making any large structural changes to the article, I have concentrated on one sub-section and have elaborated on these four facts. And, as I said, I did discuss these edits, contrary to your allegation. I had been discussing the POW section for several days before I made my recent edit. On July 19, you made this allegation that I have not discussed my edits to the POW section. The truth is that I started discussing the POW section 10 days ago, on July 10, when I started the section Talk:Jihad#Heraclius.27_Mass_Reversion_War. The issue was subsequently discussed in three lengthy sections of this discussion page, before you made this allegation. I had been discussing the POW section here for 10 days, and yet you said that I did not discuss it at all. This is therefore a false allegation on your part. Please follow the discussion page more closely if you are going to talk about who has been discussing what and since when.

 Once you are at wikiepdia for long enough you tool will probably get sick of the same type of narrow-sighted edits that continually happen by new users.  

I'm not sure who or what you are talking about. If you believe that my edit on the POW section was narrow-sighted, then please explain why - enlighten us with your apparently wide-sighted perspective.
 
 """"Maybe this is just me but it seems that ahistorical apologetics are much less dangerous than wholescale demonization and editting articles to say """"Islam says X thing that modern western society doesn't accept. Clearly, neither are very good ways to write an article but the latter has more of an agenda and is usually from the type that end up calling Zora or dab or I Muslims.""""  

Again, I am not sure who or what you are talking about. I certainly have not denounced anyone's views just because they are Muslims. On the contrary, I have said before that I wish there were more Muslims editing this article so that a wider Muslim view could represented than the one that is currently represented by the """"ahistorical apologetics"""" as you call them. 

Having said that, I strongly disagree with your opinion that no one on Wikipedia should describe any Islamic practices or laws that modern society Western does not accept. We must inevitably discuss what """"Islam says"""" about various subjects. We must report the objective facts about traditional Islamic beliefs, in a neutral fashion. Neutrality does not mean that if some traditional belief disagrees with the values of modern Western society then it must be not be mentioned. You seem to be advocating ahistorical apologetics over neutral and objective facts. You have not disproven any of my claims about POWs and Islam, but you have insisted that these objective facts are somehow """"dangerous."""" As for your allegations of """"wholesale demonization,"""" they are unwarrented. The way that Islam treats prisoners of war is completely in line with the norms of the medieval era, during which these practicies were codified. It is a fact of life that Islamic beliefs are deeply rooted in the past, and as a result they are sometimes in disagreement with modern, secular humanist values. If you were truly neutral about this subject, then you would not object to the reporting of facts just because the demonstrate a disagreement between traditional Islam and modern, secular humanist values.  It would be the pinnacle of POV pushing if the article were nothing more than ahistorical appolgetics that ommit any and all facts which demonstrate that traditional Islam is at odds with modern secular humanism.

Cadfael said Columbanus did not need the poppy syrup on this trip, and Cadfael thought the events of that day cast doubt on Jerome as the murderer, not Columbanus  until his realization that Jerome did not sleep on purpose.  Now Cadfael cast his doubts on Columbanus.  Cast doubts, not provided alibis.  

The brothers have no private property, so he can search the scrip any time.  Peredur's mother is a minor plot device so he does search; the main point is the discovery and Cadfael's new view of that day. 
Perhaps you could provide the text quotes for your changes, next time.

Quotes from the text of A Morbid Taste for Bones

Jerome lacks an alibi, rather than providing one for Columbanus in Chapter Six
""""Father, you sent me with Brother Jerome, yesterday, to keep vigil in the chapel, and pray earnestly for a good outcome, in amity and peace. Father, we came there in good time, before eleven, as I judge, and having eaten our meal, we went in and took our places, for there are prayer-desks within, and the altar is kept clean and well-tended. Oh, Father, my will to keep vigil was good, but the flesh was weak. I had not been half an hour kneeling in prayer, when I fell asleep on my arms on the desk, to my endless shame. It is no excuse that I have slept badly and thought much since we came here. Prayer should fix and purify the mind. I slept, and our cause was weakened. I must have slept all the afternoon, for the next thing I remember is Brother Jerome shaking me by the shoulder and telling me there was a messenger calling us to go with him.""""

He caught his breath, and a frantic tear rolled down his cheek, circling the bold, rounded Norman bone. """"Oh, do not look askance at Brother Jerome, for he surely never knew I had been sleeping, and there is no blame at all to him for not observing and reporting my sin. I awoke as he touched me, and arose and went with him. He thought me as earnest in prayer as he, and knew no wrong.""""
Nobody, probably, had thought of looking askance at Brother Jerome until then, but Cadfael was probably the quickest and most alert, and the only one who caught the curious expression of apprehension, fading rapidly into complacency, that passed over Brother Jerome's normally controlled countenance. Jerome had not been pursuing the same studies as Cadfael, or he would have been far from complacent. For Brother Columbanus in his self-absorbed innocence had just removed all certainty that Jerome had spent the previous noon and afternoon motionless in Saint Winifred's chapel, praying for a happy solution. His only guarantor had been fast asleep throughout. He could have sauntered out and gone anywhere he chose.

Cadfael speaking to Peredur in Chapter Nine
""""Never mind, you can show me where they lodge. Columbanus brought some of my poppy syrup with him, in case of need, the phial should be there with his scrip, he'd hardly have it on him. And as far as I know, he's had no occasion to use it, his cantrips here in Wales have been of a quieter kind. We can find a use for it now.""""

As for my failure to provide diffs for mediation / arbitration purposes regarding offensive reverts without offending party allowing discussion, don't worry; I have all the relevant diffs. Where I come from, my understanding is that complainant first states grievance, responding party then replies and indicates whether h/she agrees or disagrees, if the latter, then complainant files evidence, (i.e. would be diffs in case of wiki).

Since there isn't much to this article (or stub), I thought I would add some of my own personal experience with phenibut. I use it occasionally for insomnia. In my opinion, it is not a long term solution for insomnia. Tolerance develops for me within three days of consecutive use. I have never had a problem with withdrawal, but I have heard that is possible, but not life threatening, just uncomfortable.

Phenibut does has a long half-life so usage should be spaced out. I would recommend a maximum of one day usage according to label instructions, then a minimum of two days off. One use a week would be preferable.

It does work well for insomnia, and tends to produce vivid dreams, which is interesting, but its usage should be carefully monitored.

When used as directed, I have heard of no major side effects. It will increase the potency of sedatives, so that must be kept in mind.

This is just my own personal experience, hopefully more people will add to the discussion.",0

 Some minor revisions to the 1st paragraph of the """"Definition"""" section. 

An obviously jumbled word somehow crept into the beginning of the 2nd sentence of the paragraph:  """"The formula useoefficients of price elasticity....""""  I put in a proposed revision.  

I also changed """"quantity"""" to """"quantity demanded"""" for the sake of clarity and completeness. It's crucial that the definition be as precise as possible in emphasizing that PED is concerned only with changes in quantity demanded.  (Elasticity is one of the most difficult concepts in micro for most beginning students and for other potential readers/users  WP's """"customers""""; they tend to get confused by the slightest ambiguity about which quantity we mean.  An ounce of emphasis here doesn't preclude such confusion, but it can help avoid a pound of it.)

In addition, I added """"services"""" to the definition as a token reminder that PED, as well as the laws of supply and demand, apply to both goods and services.

The only other noteworthy revision was to the beginning of the last sentence in the first paragraph to place more emphasis on the PED for the most typical types of goods and services.  Although the Giffen and Veblen exceptions are interesting, they are almost negligibly rare anomalies compared to the overwhelming number of typical goods and services governed by the Law of Demand.  (That's why it merits the rare status of a """"Law""""!)  The exceptions deserve discussion eventually (in a later section), but I think this introductory paragraph would be strengthened by giving them only the briefest possible mention in passing here.  Instead, this paragraph should focus attention on the crux of the issue that readers need to remember (the """"take-away""""), namely:  because the demand for most goods and services obeys the Law of Demand, their PED coefficients will always be negative.  

Again, elasticity is one of the most difficult topics at the introductory level of microeconomics.  It doesn't serve this section or the article well to risk distracting students and other readers from the main point too early with such minor exceptions, however interesting they may be to the intellectually curious readers. Once we've made the main point as clear as possible, then devoting some time to the exceptions is much less likely to cause confusion or ambiguity.
  
I have one more suggested revision along this line for the paragraph, and I'll return to it as soon as time permits.

I made a few other copyedits were purely minor, e.g., deleting an occasional unnecessary word to polish the prose just a bit.

All Trayvon had to do is call the cops if he was soooo scared. 

The cops did NOT tell Zimmerman NOT to follow him. There's a HUGE diff btw a 911 operator and a cop. Telling someone 'we don't need you to do that' is NOT the same as a direct order and finally, Zimmmerman claims he DID stop following at that point.

Had you not read the workshop and evidence pages? Had you not discussed which proposals to include? I thought that was the whole point of what you do. The ensuing unprecedented scramble to include Bishonen's proposal baffled edt sum the clerk and led to the present unfortunate epilogue.

At the beginning of this case the arbitration committee let it be known that the case was about Nina Green, despite LHvU's opening statement. In the middle of the case the secondary drafting arbitrator was happy to keep up the banter on Bishonen's talk page, but he and 15 other active arbs somehow failed to respond to Nina Green's direct question to the committee on the workshop page """"Is there any case against me which I have to meet?...What do the arbitrators feel they need to hear from me?""""

Thank you for making it clear that you either are not reading my messages, or are being deliberately churlish. I didn't say anything about images being retained without a rationale. I already explained clearly above the matter regarding the rationale, and if you're either too illiterate or too lazy to read and comprehend this, then perhaps you should not engage me in discussion.

I made the edit summary that I thought was appropriate, as I'm quite tired of obnoxious deletionists like Triangle who make false accusations and no attempt to communicate with others, as well as persistent liars like yourself who think repeatedly putting words in other people's mouths constitutes """"discussion"""". If you don't like my edit summaries, then tough shit.

Do you not understand the difference between scientific taxonomy and scientific nomenclature? It isn't my job to explain it; you should be able to google it easily enough.

The article you're citing is about taxonomy. It asserts that scientific taxonomy is a Renaissance codification of folk taxonomic principles. It is not about nomenclature. It has nothing whatsoever to say about nomenclature. It does not make the connection between vernacular names and scientific names that you are claiming for it.

I understand this. Guettarda understands this: """"Fundamentally, the Raven paper is about higher taxa, not species, not binomials. Not related to this paragraph in any meaningful way."""" Casliber understands this: """"I have to concur with Guettarda and Hesperian - it doesn't touch on the issue of binomial names really at all.""""

Hennessy knew what he was writing about, and indeed, died at the hands of rough trade. His close friend James Lees Milne, who was bisexual, and with whom one can presume he would have shared the more unpublishable results of his findings, wrote the first frank biography of Lord Esher, the grey eminence of the Edwardian royal court who was pederastic, and who kept a folder of letters from parties about the scandal.

 Islamic Terrorism / Islamic Militancy 

Since Hkelkar won't stop reverting my edits, why does this page insist on going by the loaded terms of the past and writing """"Islamic terrorism"""" and """"Islamic militancy""""?

Think of Kashmir in 1900: There were Hindus and Muslims living with one another. There were no wars being fought. Then, after the partion, which created nations, there suddenly was a militancy problem. Same exact scenario in Israel. Thus, these insurgencies or resistances or whatever you want to call them can not be claimed to be Islamic, when these two regions clearly had Islamic culture and Muslims from hundreds of years prior without terrorists.""",0

First thing you need to know, is that Good Article status is a crock of shit. The criteria for it is a fair model, and it is not the problem. The problem is that it is not governed by a committee. Any bozo, like yourself, is allowed to review an article and ultimately decide if the article, in their mind, merits inclusion into CGD (Club Green Dot). The bar sits firmly in the mud. Snakes slither across it. My articles, on the other hand, never have enjoyed the benefits of exception. With extreme prejudice, they have been held to the highest possible standard set by the criteria.

Now we get to your GA review of Howling Bells, which I would like a full explanation for. That's one of the agreements that I have set forth, in order for you to avoid failure of your articles, by me. You can decide if you would like to abide by this resolution or not. Tell me something, are you on drugs, prescription or otherwise? If that offends you I apologize, but your review made me think of three things. Either somebody took a shit on your face and you couldn't see through it, you had a big D in your ass, or you were in a state of incoherence brought on by substance abuse. I must confess, I'm ashamed that I'm even having to talk to some punk ass high school kid who listens to crappy music. Not that I feel that I hold a higher place in this world than you, because Lord knows that's not the case. It's just that, I'm sittin' here having to deal with some goddamn little kid over the computer. Even at your age, I know you understand where I'm coming from.

There's not much of a reward getting an article to GA status, aside from that dot. A small part of me would like to see the article at GA, but it really doesn't concern me a whole lot whether it gets there or not. Howling Bells is at GA and that's basically good enough for me. As far as Halfway Gone goes, at this point, it's outta my hands. You're just gonna have to accept the fact the article could possibly be de-listed. Consider that your penalty for fuckin' around with other people's hard work.

Ok, so there are two agreements I have come up with that I think are very acceptable.

A full explanation of your GA review of Howling Bells (album). I'll guide you through it on the review page. If you decide to play ball, good on ya.
You must say the following to me, here on my talk page: I, , am just a punk ass teenager, who loves Justin Beiber, loves the crappy music of Justin Beiber, and loves crappy music from many other crappy artists.
The font has to be huge too, none of this small crap. Also, see if you can do it in some kind of color, that would be cool.

Now, I will not pass your articles if you agree to this, but I will not fail them. Instead, I will explain on the review pages that any reviewing of the articles that I have done up until this point should be disregarded. My reasoning will be because of my inexperience as a first time reviewer has led me to realize that I am not capable for such a task. I will wash my hands of the articles, take them off hold, and request that another editor undertake the review. If you are unwilling to accept these agreements, than you leave me no other choice but to expeditiously fail the articles. Let me know what you wanna do kid.  (meow)",1

The problem is they've spent considerable time in making SEPARATE ARTICLES (yes, you hear right) for each of their so-called dvd seasons (which are dvd releases actually so not even the naming is appropriate), and they're not willing to give up because that would render every dvd article useless.

 Dispute 

I noticed there's an edit war going on with regard to the debunkingprimaltherapy link, and the link at the end of the """"Primal Therapy"""" section.

My opinion is as follows. I think the link at the end of the """"Primal Therapy"""" section should lead to the """"Primal Therapy"""" article, not to the criticism section specifically. I feel that way because the section in the page entitled """"Primal Therapy"""" is relevant to the entire primal therapy article (including the criticisms) and not to the criticisms alone.

It would be quite possible to have both links at the bottom of the paragraph (""""see Primal Therapy, including the criticism section...""""). I wouldn't be opposed to that. 

Personally I don't believe that the section """"Primal Therapy"""" should be on the biography page at all; we should have a link only: """"Arthur Janov is the creator of (linked) Primal Therapy, and author of many books on that subject"""". IMO there is no need to discuss primal therapy (or its criticisms) in any detail on a biography page, because those things are not biographical details. They are not relevant here. They belong in the Primal Therapy article, and there is no need to repeat that article here.

With regard to the DBT.com link. I don't believe this page is an appropriate place for any kind of dispute about Primal Therapy, one way or the other, since this article is not about Primal Therapy. I don't believe that we should include here links to any sites unless they are specifically relevant to the biography of Arthur Janov. If we do have any such links  (like the DBT.com link) then we must revisit the whole debate here, and we must include other links, otherwise we violate NPOV by representing only one side. It would be better just not to have such links.

Bear in mind that Art Janov is an exceedingly minor historical figure. His biography should be only a few paragraphs. It's not really the best place for an extensive argument.

I realize you guys are concerned about people being led astray by reading the wiki, but I really don't think that's a major concern. Anyone who follows a """"Primal Therapy"""" link and reads the article will realize that Primal Therapy has been criticized. The readers aren't dense and don't need things repeated. In other words, I don't think anyone could be misled or led astray by a simple link (and nothing more) on the biography page.

We should achieve some kind of consensus before editing the article. If we can't achieve consensus then we should solicit outside opinion.

I take it you will have to look more in the area of Madison Grant, Charles Davenport, Henry Ford, and all the other nice American industrialists who wrote most of the eugenic literature in the early 20th century.

Charles Davenport even received a letter from a Jewish member of some editorial board concerning a racial hygiene board - previously this Jewish doctor had been considered for an editorial role on some German racial hygiene theory - but guess what - the Nazis didn't tell him he was soon about to become 'racially unfit' too. Talk about having some of your own medicine. Anyway, he wrote a letter to Charles Davenport pleading for him to denounce the Nazis' action. Guess what - not only did he NOT REPLY, but he also had leading positions on that same German magazine's editorial board a year later.

Re the contested edit. I'm not really bothered about the inclusion or otherwise of this edit. Its about a parallel issue. I did add it back because I know that if I didn't then someone else surely will. Its an interesting observation and in my view a true one. The discussion has decended into one of semantics about wealthy and industrialized that I'd rather not get into. The other editors are doing a good job battling that one out. I just have a gut feeling that the U.S. is in a different league economically from China though I would accept that this is changing fast. It is odd that China, socialist country, does not guarantee health care for all its citizens. It does for many, but not for all. As far as I recall it had more to do with the government being unwilling to pay doctors enough to persuade them to work in the rural areas. They can earn more in the wealthier cities.

 Re: History merges 

The instructions are all laid out at Wikipedia:How to fix cut-and-paste moves. As I found out quickly, when you try to move an article from Title A to Title B and Title B already exists, the software will automatically delete the edits of Title B for you when you move the article. Try to minimise the number of revisions you need to delete and restore as deleting and restoring pages is one of the most taxing operations in MediaWiki. Also, it's a good idea to say in the move summary that the move shouldn't be reverted. Once I was history merging Melbourne, and a well-meaning editor tried to move it back while I was working on the history merge, which resulted in Melbourne disappearing from Wikipedia for a few minutes. Maybe I'll try the same thing at Auckland one day -). Hope this helps some. ''''''87 """,0

Thanks for your message on my talk page. When I voted keep for Tom G. Palmer, I justified it by writing that """"Google returns 13500 hits for the query """"Tom G. Palmer"""" cato [3]."""" """"Tom G. Palmer"""" alone returns 34,900 hits on Google [4]. So on this point, my vote is not necessarily inconsistent (34,900 > 19,000).
Well, sure, but that's weak""""35000 is notable, but 19000 isn't"""". Come on. That's not serious.

But even if you had 50,000 hits on Google, I might also have refrained from voting. This is mainly because I am concerned about you putting so much pressure to have your own article. If I was in your position, I would probably keep my distance from the discussion. You are a primary source of information for yourself and, in that sense, your position might be biased. I am not sure whether your attitude fits with the Neutral point of view policy (which applies to articles, but probably also to the way the encyclopedia should be created as a whole). I don't know, and I prefer to abstain from the vote.
Understandable, and advice well taken and appreciated. But I am a justice seeker. I really don't care as much if my entry is deleted or not, as for whether I fight to vindicate my unfair treatment (as I perceive it). Here I was, many moon ago, minding my own damn business, and someone tells me I have a Wiki entry. Interesting. Then someone says it's up for delete. What do I care. I really don't give a damn. But some jerk says it's non-notable (okay by meI didn't konw Wiki policies on this at the time anyway); and vanity. Implying I did it, as self-promotion. This pissed me off. I rebutted the latter charge and did not even mention the notable charge. Later, many months later, someone tells me he has initiated VfD for Palmer's site. Now this was right after the Wiki entries of some CLEARLY notable friends of mine were vandalizedHans-Hermann Hoppe, Lew Rockwell with ridiculous charges of racism etc., of the same type made by Palmer. So I figure, let's take a look at his entry. I did so, and in the ensuing VfD debate, realize there are actual policies on this; I studied them and thought, """"son of a bitch. I qualify. By their own policies. These wikinerds should not have deleted me. And to top it off, the same one who voted to delete me is voting to keep Palmer. Something ain't right."""" So, instead of dishonestly putting up my entry anonymously or through a meatpuppet, I did it myself, nothing hidden. And instead of rolling over and playing dead as I did last time, I decided this time, I will make noise and make sure that if I have anything ot say about it, the voters will be made aware of the policies. That is all. If a fair evaluation of my site and aplication of the policies leads to a good faith vote to delete my entry, I don't care. But what do I see? Peopel who vote to keep Palmer up on the grounds that he is openly gay, or has a large number of publications, or has 13000 google hits, voting to delete me, even though I have similar criteria. It makes it seem arbitrary to me. So can you blame me for monitoring this a little bit, and being a bit frustrated at the seemingly arbitrary actions of some people? Nom.

Obviously, Wikipedia is the encyclopedia only people with proprietary interest in an article can edit. You're part of the problem. Underwood had an effect on the church, or at bare minimum is an 'in-joke' therefore there should be mention of him in the article. I can see your mind is made up though, so I'll save my breath, there's no point having integrity when surrounded by folks determined to enforce their bias and other folks too busy to research the subject properly (it took you several minutes to research hundreds of posts and relationships between church members and Underwood). I'm done. Your arrogance is plain as day. I didn't claim to have made a perfect edit, I even suggested re-editing in the talk page. However Underwood's effect is plain as day, and as such should be mentioned. The reason I'm leery of the 'custodians' of the page is because in adding the Bob Black bombing I encountered the same kind of opposition. I'm not opposed to the Church, I just think that articles deserve more than custodial opinions by caretaker editors who have a vested interest in the outcome of the article. You were just in too big a hurry. I have a fair amount of experience editing, and know that a mention shouldn't require a full-on assault to accomplish when there is proof of association. I'm not trying to make the Church look guilty, just trying to keep accuracy on a topic that (if you research the Underwood article) often has been edited less than veraciously and is a continuously recurring discussion topic in alt.slack even 5 years after the murders.

The 2008 ratification of The Great Lakes Commission finally commits American and Canadian governments to the geographical definition of the North American Great Lakes as a distinctive political entity.  In fact and operation, the complex cooperative management of The Great Lakes for purposes of trade, border discipline, parks, transportation, hydro-power, water management and environmental protection has been a reality since 1815.   Ethnically and economically, the borders have always been porous.   Politically, the region has more bi-national commonalities than generally supposed.    Much of Ontarian political culture derived from both Anglo-American heritage and the simultaneous influence and threat of American examples.   More importantly, both the American and Canadian sides played analogous roles in the world-economy.

But they all were telling lies

 16)If anyone comes under the shadow of Huma bird, no one can lay its hands on it-not even a brave cow.
 17)If a man sits behind the back of a lion neither anyone can catch him nor a goat or a sheep or a deer can even pass nearby.
 (Aurangzeb ! I stand in shadow of the Almighty and your men who are like goats,sheep and deer could not harm me inspite of your deceptions.)
 18)If I had deceived by taking oath on Holy Quran like the way you have done, I would not have bought my dear fighters to this position of disadvantage (by bringing them out of Anandgarh fort).

 21)It was out of sheer helplessness that I came in the battle field.(Having thus decided) I came with all the battle plans and munitions.
 22)When all stratagem employed for (solving) a problem are exhausted, only then taking your hand to the sword is legitimate.
 (This is the most quoted of Zafarnamah.300 years ago, Guru Gobind singh ji had laid down the circumstances when a person or a nation can pick up the sword against the other)
 23)What trust can I have on your oath on Quran ? Otherwise you tell why should I have taken path of taking up the sword.
 24)I do not know that this person (Aurangzeb) is cunning like a fox.Otherwise I would never have come to this place that is Chamkaur (by vacating Anandgarh on the false oaths of Aurangzeb and his men).

Instead, you choose to act like a self-appointed wikipedia police, running about throwing up the blue flags of WP rules and being a generally obnoxious person with no real use. Instead of actually contributing useful original edits to articles you seem to think this is the old Newpedia where people are expected to submit edits for your approval. If too many others take the same tac WP will collapse into dross. You violate every rule in the book of which you accuse others. You are a mean spirited, very angry person that drives away editors with your sarcastic responses and general high-handed behavior. I suspect you have no real special knowledge of any of the articles upon which you squat like a vulture waiting tear apart others creative edits. You really need to crack a book and study up on a subject or two and find an article you feel needs rewriting and to straighten out the too turgid, redundant writing that exists here on WP. Stop trying to act like you are an administrator and grow up.

At a time when WP needs more editors, particularly female, you with your coarse, rude behavior is the last thing WP needs. You are, to summarize it, a net negative.  I am amazed that you have not been banned but I suppose your facility at quoting the rules, all while completely violating the spirit of WP preserves you.

Let me give this an example, let's say I'm talking about the 2004 US Presidential Election. Suppose I say this:

""""Only 60 million Americans (out of the 300 million Americans total) voted to re-elect President Bush."""" 
This sentence is technically true, and it is technically factual, but it is also misleading and unfair to President Bush. The sentence implies that while only 60 million supported the President, the other 240 million didn't vote for him. This is technically true, but it's totally unfair and misleading. The fact is, most American's don't vote, and the majority of those 300 million were """"undecided"""", not """"opposed to Bush"""". And as we know, Bush was, in fact, the most popular candidate. So to say """"60 million out of 300 million total supported Bush"""" is simply very, very misleading even if every word of it happens to be true.

So saying others with different policies are opposed to BSAis the same kind inferrence some were vehemently against.  ;-)

 A """"hint of longing?"""", a """"HINT of longing?""""  It's more like an avalanche of teenage angst because your crush won't reciprocate! 

a melancholic song about unrequited love, especially because itâs all crescendo and no denouement: Listeners never find out if the main character actually gets her wishâmuch less if the person sheâs confessing her love to actually feels the same way. âAll I Want For Christmas Is Youâ is a one-sided confession of wants and desires, not a song describing or celebrating a consummated relationship. âHonestly, the lyrics, to me, come off as hopelessly sad,â Williems says.  âIâve read the critical reception section of the songâs Wikipedia page, and I canât help but think the critics werenât really listening. One critic seems to claim there is a âhint of longing,â which might be the understatement of the century.

If you wanted to get real bummed about it, I think the argument could be made that the song is denouncing the artificiality surrounding the spectacle of Christmas,â he continues. âSaying that you are so hung up on the negative of not being with one person on Christmas that you canât embrace the joy of the holiday is really pretty sad, but also movingly honest for a pop Christmas song.

b54c9836601eb78a,"""Kurt and Dave get it on?==

Groaning Kurt released his cock. For the past week he hadn't been able to get off. He tried a cocktail of drugs and a cocktail of whores. Nothing was doing it for him. Masturbating in the shower wasn't even working. Oh he was getting hard all right, he just couldn't fucking cum. And it was driving him nuts.

To top it off, he didn't know why he couldn't cum. The girls had been either hot enough or slutty enough. Even the couple of guys he brought home had been decent. Despite that, he couldn't fucking cum. And a week of that was enough to make anyone more pissy than normal.

Which meant band practice was unlikely to be much fun for anyone.

That was made abundantly clear the moment Kurt stepped into the rehearsal studio. His eyes flicked from Krist to Dave and he came to a sudden stop. Dave was sitting on a couch, a pretty girl in his lap giggling. It was like he was taunting Kurt. And he would have nothing of that.

Stalking over to the drummer and the floozie, Kurt pulled her forcibly out of his lap. The girl squealed and Dave growled, but Kurt paid no attention, forcing the girl out of the studio. After slamming the door he headed back over to Dave. Without a word he pulled the drummer to him and kissed him possessively.

Dave shoved Kurt away, """"What part of no don't you fucking understand!?""""

Krist's eyes widened and he took a step forward, """"Guys, I thinkâ""""

Kurt sent him a silent glare, silencing and stopping him.

""""I don't want you, Kurt. I don't even fucking like you right now,"""" Dave growled. """"In fact, I fucking quit! I don't have to put up with this shit. You're fucking insane. You need some other crackwhore to take my place. I'm not it.""""

Sidestepping the singer, Dave headed towards the door. He barely made three steps before Kurt grabbed him again. This time his back was pulled to Kurt's front. He could clearly feel the singer's erection pressing into his ass.

He wasn't going to be anyone's bitch.

""""I'm just gonna... go,"""" Krist muttered before slipping out of the room quickly.

""""You're fucking mine, Dave,"""" Kurt declared, licking Dave's neck. """"Always.""""

For as small as he was, Kurt had more strength than Dave expected. With considerably less effort than he would have figured, the singer forced the drummer down to the floor. Dave wiggled and tried to crawl away, but all that resulted was in Kurt pulling the drummer's pants off.

Laying down on top of Dave while he worked his own pants off, Kurt hissed in his ear, """"You're mine. You hear me? Fucking mine.""""

""""Stop! Kurt, stop!"""" Dave struggled.

With Kurt's weight on him, the drummer had very little maneuverability. He was completely trapped. But that didn't mean he stopped trying to get away. While wholly his struggling was probably a good thing, it wasn't really helping. If anything it was turning Kurt on more.

Not having the patience to remove Dave's boxers, Kurt reached down and tore the back seam, exposing the drummer's ass. He didn't even pause to warn Dave. His hands spread Dave's cheeks, spit down his crack to provide some lubrication, and quickly pushed his cock in. Dave screamed, wiggling once more to get away. With Kurt's hands holding onto his hips, he had no chance to go anywhere, at least not until the singer was done.

Dave's screams faded into sobs. That alone drove Kurt further, faster. He loved everything about it. The way Dave's ass squeezed his cock better than anyone else's had before. He was a perfect glove, a perfect fit. Before too long a week's worth of unreleased cum spurted from Kurt's cock.

Slowly he pulled out, not really caring about the mixture of blood and semen leaking from Dave's ass. Grinning to himself he refastened his pants. He glanced at Dave, a feeling of superiority infusing him. He totally owned Dave now. 

Does anyone have any basis for this rumour? I would love to put it on the main page.

 Flagship is singular 

Many states have two (or more) excellent state universities; often, one may exceed the other on one or another measure of excellence.  But a state with two excellent universities has that - not two flagships.  """"Flagship"""" is a singular term - a good reference for the word generally can be found here.  In this context, """"flagship"""" means, as the introduction says, """"the leading comprehensive public research university in a given U.S. state"""".  (The only sort of exception that makes sense in this context is a system like New York's, where the state university system resembles a system of franchises more than anything else.)  With this in mind I've edited the list to remove some schools that are plainly not a state's """"flagship"""".  I left a state's entry alone if I wasn't sure, and so some double-entries do remain; someone who knows those schools better should fix those.

""""...of all elements in a product""""

You wrote """"Elements such as colour tone,..."""" The official name of the element is just colour, and should remain like that to maintain it as a professional reference.

You wrote: """"Therefore it is in the product designers best interest...""""  You're missing an apostrophe, it should be:
""""Therefore it is in the product designer's best interest"""" or """"Therefore it is in the product designers' best interest""""

You wrote: """"Keeping in mind about how consumers ..."""" It's convoluted, it should be:
""""Keeping in mind how consumers...""""

You wrote: """"The solution to that is to create a product, that in its designed appearance and function, expresses..."""" In order to make it flow better, since the commas here are used as a parenthesis, it should be:
""""The solution to that is to create a product that, in its designed appearance and function, expresses..."""" That way, if you were to take out the part between the commas, the sentence would still flow.

You wrote: """"...subject to peoples judgment..."""" You're missing an apostrophe again. It should be:
""""...subject to people's judgment...""""

Third, making a point about what city really is the second most populus French-speaking city is out of place in this article, although it would be useful to state why there is uncertainty about whether or not Kinshasa is a French-speaking city.

I was not given any possibility of replying to the block request discussion, because he also did not link this anywhere on my page and on his page I saw a template (posted to him by a user of a different time he has done this) stating that doing so is required.  Basically, the user who reported me shows clearly in """"bad faith"""". The fact that I am being forced to defend on myself on Wikipedia for 12+ hours is not a valid reason for a block.  No """"personal attacks"""" were made, no """"refusal"""" to do anything was done as no """"orders"""" were given that could be """"refused"""" due to the fact the """"orders"""" did not even happen, and being a victim of others who are repeatedly attacking me and even deleting my replies from discussion pages before archiving, and defending myself from these continuous attacks, is NOT a valid reason for a block.  As for the articles which caused people to attack and harass me, nothing regarding these articles was ever properly done.  No messages asking to discuss it, no polls done to find out which information is correct, no editing done after my edits for the purpose of further improving the article, nothing constructive or reasonable whatsoever, just reverting the entire edit without discussion or reasonableness, lying about the reason for reverting, harassment, and making fraudulent claims against me such as """"adding information without sources"""", regardless of the fact that 1) I did not ADD any information to the article and 2) it is okay to add information that does not have  a source, and most new articles consist mainly, and some entirely, of such information.  Someone wrote something about """"friendly advice,"""" but not a SINGLE related comment was at all """"friendly,"""" and no advice was given whatsoever except for one which was both unhelpful and contained more untrue statements.  Even this administrator is purposefully making blatantly fraudulent statements, claiming that I """"ignored guidelines in regards to my signature"""", regardless of the fact that the one who changed Wikipedia's code to no longer link automatically is not me, nor did they notify me, nor could anyone think of a reasonable reason to do this, regardless of the fact that it has been less then 24 hours since anyone requested that I learn programming code and then re-code my signature to compensate for this flaw, that's right less then 24 hours let alone a reasonable time of 4 months or so (assuming the user has logged in for several hours every day during that time), and regardless of the fact that even in that minuscule amount of time my signature had already been re-coded before he ever did this block.  This shows that the administrator himself is specifically in bad faith by citing an alleged """"problem"""" that no longer even exists.  There is also a log of the LITERAL AND DIRECT EXACT OPPOSITE of the claim of the person who reported me (again, WITHOUT NOTIFYING ME TO REPLY TO THE DISCUSSION ON THE MATTER), at the Help Desk page.  I advise that people looking at this do not read that conversation as evidence of replies and such, because several of my replies were deleted before the conversation was archived and therefore it is an invalid archive, BUT it does show the exact opposite of this claim in that I specifically complained about someone for doing that very thing because the conversation between MYSELF AND HIM should be done at only ONE place, and should also be done at one of the appropriate pages, rather then being harassive by using different places as this Administrator is claiming I have done when there is direct evidence that I've done the opposite.  So the main thing being that I am the victim of numerous people attacking me, they should not have attacked me but instead should have done any of the things I mentioned, or some other reasonable thing, rather then reverting edits and then attacking and harassing me.  I did not deserve any such harassment and attacks and do have the right to defend such things.  If I am treated fairly instead then there could be a discussion on the matter instead of repeated reverting without any discussion, then no such people would be """"reporting"""", but, since I did not do the things in the report other then correcting articles, and since the decent reply to correcting articles which someone else thinks are incorrect is not to attack them as was done to me, the block is wrong because things should be differently and because the people who were """"edit warring"""" on purpose were other people rather then myself.

 BUSH AND JFK 

The recent 50th anniversary upsurge in Kennedy assasination interest and the imminent releast of classified information in 2017 has caused many conspiracy theories to be re-examined.  More often GHW Bush's name is linked as a conspirator and funder of the conspiracy.  His favoring of Nixon at the time and his oil interests superficially endorse this theory, as does the depth of Nixon's corrupt and dupklicitous influence on those close to him.

I feel the biog needs to highlight this aspect of GHWB's career, especially as both Bush presidents were such avid war-mongers their financial interests must have relied heavily on the """"military-industrial"""" influence that Eisenhower warned the nation against.  Bush's attitudes to war in the middle east directly reflects the false policies which prolonged the Vietnam war.""",0

 This article is horrible because it confuses concepts 

the USBIG definition 

""""The Basic Income Guarantee is an unconditional, government-insured guarantee that all citizens will have enough income to meet their basic needs."""",

and their page in general talks about a mix of Basic Income (BI) and Guaranteed Income (GI).  Although the article goes to great pains to explain the difference between BI and GI, and claim that BIG is BI and not GI.  The above definition of BIG is in fact GI and not BI.

""""unconditional"""" aspect of BI, doesn't mean there is no forms to fill out and no approval needed

""""government-insured guarantee"""" is pure GI, because the implementation is to subsidize people up to an income level.  A guaranteed income of $15000 means that if your income from other source is above $15000 you receive no benefit, if your income is $14000, you receive $1000, and if your income is 0, you receive $15000.

Basic income of $10000 means that you receive $10000 no matter what your other income is.

I can volunteer to make the radical changes to this page to make BIG mean BI, or I can alter the Basic Income page to no longer point to this page.  I will do so in a few days, assuming no one wants to insist on reverting the changes.""",0

1. Gene_poole, it is not MY pet project - as stated clearly more than once above. That's one more proof you don't read thoroughly what people write - and similarly, you don't check thoroughly things which you delete. Thus, I'm not convinced you can give any actual evidence there's an explainable reason for deleting it. The quote I provided in the initial letter here is a quote from the creator of this project. He said his opinion about you clearly. Not that he cares about any Wiki trolls, Mr know-it-alls and control freaks. The fact that he doesn't even bother wasting his nerves on this discussion here is eloquent enough. But I do care when I see injustice. Not that my """"little rant"""" would change anything. But am I someone who remains silence? I could at least make my """"various pronouncements"""" when I saw injustice. Wikipedia at least allows this, doesn't it? As for the proofs, links and evidence you requested, I shall commit my efforts to collecting them with the guidance from the original creator of the Alphistia project, and present them to you here. After that, it is up to you, to show whether justice really exists in Wikipedia or it is really subject to control by self-authorised junkies as my impression has always told me.

2. I understand the rules of Wikipedia and its standards for verifiability. But I can name you at least a dozen Wiki entries which don't have verifiable source either, save some crafted websites linked to them (that's not a reliable source, anyone can put up a website about anything) - and they still remain. Moreover, I cannot see how you made the conclusion that Alphistia was """"made up in school in one day"""" by reading """"my webpage"""". And, aren't most other invented utopian micronations created in exactly the same circumstances? Isn't this exactly what it's all about? It's not about existing micronations.

3. """"Wikipedia places a high value on verifiable reliable sources"""" - that's pretty ridiculous, as far as anyone's invented micronation is concerned. Invented projects like this do not exist - that's the main idea of utopia. What a material proof do you require? This project has been around the place for many years, and has been presented in internet space for quite a long time - and in more than one place (it has its own website, its own LiveJournal blog and a network of fans and devotees who have developed a community and have even started learning the invented language of the micronation in question) - but all this remained out of your sight as you were deleting it at random, without even checking anything about it. My only conclusion: it made you jealous, and abusing the powers that Wikipedia gives you, you did not hesitate for a minute to do what you've always done (yes, I've been following your epics over here for some time).

4. """"Do you have press coverage, books, real-world items proving it's been an active, well known project?"""" - if you had made the smallest of researches, you'd have found out that this project has participated on a number of exhibitions (the latest one, in Germany) and has picked up some awards among other such invented micronation projects. As for real-world items, the only ones for now are postal stamps issued in recent years - that's something I doubt most of the projects on this list can pride of.

In conclusion, I think this discussion remains pointless until the moment when I provide the above """"proofs and evidence"""" requested. Then, I'll be looking forward to your response.

As for the statement about Wikipedia pronounced in the above Letter, I believe things will change some day here too, though this looks rather unlikely at present. One day, guys like you will be stripped off their undeserved powers. Because the idea behind Wikipedia is too utopian itself - complete freedom brings anarchy. But I admire its democratic principle - everyone has equal rights to express their opinions without being deleted or edited by someone else to whom they don't sound suitable. As for the Truth, the Facts (what is """"notable"""" enough), the Truth is only what the more powerful present it to be.

bac5d7a187cd528a,"Absolute Proof that 0.999... IS NOT EQUAL TO 1 
A math-wiki:

You are wrong about infinite representation. The ancient Greeks *never* represented 1/3 as 0.333... 

Now let me refute your argument regarding the transitive property:

A)    1=3(1/3)
B)    3(1/3) = 3(0.333...)
C)    3(0.333...) =0.999... 

The problem here occurs in B) where you assume that 3 * 0.333... = 3 * 1/3. You have 'not proved' anything. On the contrary, you have only proved that you are assuming 1/3 = 0.333... which it is obviously 'not equal'. 0.333... is an 'indeterminate' number because it cannot be represented finitely in base 10. 
0.333... is not equal to 1/3 so you cannot say that 1/3 is a finite representation. An indeterminate number is a number that is repeating in any
radix system.

You mention the division algorithm but do you know what it says? The division algorithm has 'nothing' to do with radix systems. Let me state it for you - If a and b are two given integers, there are unique integers q and r
such that a=bq + r and  0<= r < b. Now I will use the division algorithm to prove that you are WRONG once and for all. Suppose a = 1 and b = 0.999..., then 
what are the integers q and r such that the above is true?

Suppose that q = 0 and r = 1. Then the division algorithm fails because it makes a false statement i.e. q and r can both be 0 and 1 respectively.
For example: 1 = (0.999...)(1)+0 and 1 = (0.999...)(0)+1. So by default, the
division algorithm is proved false if 0.999... is equal to 1. And you can say a lot of things about the Greeks, but they would not make a stupid mistake like this. They were the smartest race in ancient times.

Now suppose that you try to tell me that either form is acceptable in the case of 0 and 1, you will still end up with a terrible contradiction:

1=(0.999...)(0)+1. The second form in this case implies that 1 < 0.999... since r < b. But how can 1 be less than 0.999... ??!!

The copy of the Process was shown to me is the true Copy made. I acknowledge my own and my companion's signatures, and that it is the truth. Two other copies were made. One was given to the Inquisitor, one to the King of England, and one to the Bishop of Beauvais. This Process was made from a certain Minute written in French, by my own hand, which was given up to the Judges, and was afterwards translated from the French into Latin by Monsieur Thomas de Courcelles and myself, in the form in which it now stands, as well and as faithfully as possible, long after the death and execution of Jeanne. As for the Act of Accusation and other parts of the Process, Maitre Thomas de Courcelles had very little to do with these, nor did he greatly interfere with them. 

With regard to the word Nota, written above certain Articles in the Minute, there was, on the first day of the Inquiry, a great tumult in the Chapel of the Castle at Rouen, where, that day, the interrogation was held, so that Jeanne was interrupted at almost every word, while she was speaking of her apparitions: Certain secretaries were there-two or three-of the King of England, who registered, as they chose, her words and depositions, omitting all her defense and all which tended to exonerate her. I complained of this, saying it was irregular, and that I would not be responsible, as clerk, in this matter: and, therefore, on the morrow, the place of meeting was changed and convened in a certain hall of the Castle, near the Great Hall, while two English were placed to keep order. When there were difficulties as to Jeanne's answers, and some said she had not replied as I had written, I wrote Nota at the top, in order that the questions might be repeated and the difficulties removed. Although it is mentioned in the Process that the Judges stated they had received preliminary evidence, I do not remember to have seen or heard of it; but I know that, if it had been produced, it would have been inserted in the Process. 

Jeanne was brought to Rouen and not to Paris, because, as I think, the King of England and the principal people of his Council were there. 

At the beginning of the Process, I was sent for to attend a meeting held at a certain house near the Castle, at which were present the Bishop of Beauvais, the Abbe' of Fecamp, Maitre Nicolas Loyseleur, and many others. The Bishop told me it was necessary that I should serve the King: that they meant to bring a fine case against this said Jeanne, and that I was to recommend another greffier to assist me. I therefore nominated Boisguillaume. 

I met Lohier in the Church, on the day after the Bishop had asked him to give an opinion on the Process, and inquired what he you ght of it. He replied, that the Process was of no value, and could not be maintained, because it was conducted in the Castle and not in a legal court; that it concerned many who were not summoned; that Jeanne had no Counsel: and for many other reasons. He added that, in his opinion, it was their intention to put her to death. 

A certain Maitre Nicolas de Houppeville was summoned to attend the Trial; and was in great danger, because he refused. Maitre Jean Lemaitre, Sub-Inquisitor, delayed as long as possible his attendance at the Trial, and was much vexed at being compelled to attend. 

One day, when Jeanne was being questioned, Jean de Chatillon spoke in her favor, saying that she was not compelled to reply to the question put to her, or to that effect. This much displeased the Bishop of Beauvais and his following, and there was a great tumult at his words. The Bishop ordered him to be quiet, and to let the Judges speak. 

On another occasion, when some one was advising and directing Jeanne on the question of submission to the Church, the Bishop said, """"Hold your tongue, in the devil's name!"""" I do not remember the name of him who was thus spoken to. 

One day, some one, whose name I do not remember, having spoken of Jeanne in a way which did not please the Earl of Stafford, the latter followed him, sword in hand, to some place of sanctuary; and, if they had not told Stafford that that place was sacred, he would have slain him. 

Those who seemed to me most affected [against Jeanne] were Beaupere, Midi, and de Touraine. 

One day, I went with the Bishop of Beauvais and the Earl of Warwick to the prison where Jeanne was, and we found her in irons. It was said that at night she was fastened with iron chains; but I did not see her so fas",0

Grammar desk
There hasn't be a groundswell of support, but then there hasn't really been any opposition, either. And no-one has told me that I can't do it. I plan to go ahead next week and start the page. Here's what I will do:
Create """"Wikipedia/Grammar desk"""" with an introduction explaining the purpose of the page, similar to those on Wikipedia:Help desk and Wikipedia:Reference desk.
Post my """"was a former"""" question to get the ball rolling.
Create links to the page from Wikipedia:Ask a question, Wikipedia:Manual of style, and anywhere else that seems logical.
Create """"Wikipedia:Grammar desk/FAQs"""" that would start with my explanation of that/which and, with your permission, your explanation of its/it's.
Would you be willing to help me run it by helping to answer the questions? Do you have any suggestions?

I don't think there will be a lot of problems with UK spelling and grammar  there are a lot of UK editors. Sometime I'll explain Canadian spelling, which is a hybrid of UK and US spelling that gives us phrases like """"labour organization"""" and """"tire centre"""", which would not be spelled that way in either the UK or the US.

Nonsense. Yes of course there were constitutional amendments in July but those occurred all the time in the previous 45 years, they are hardly a relevant turning point of some sort. When I mentioned constitutional changes I was referring yo the new constitution, which might be taken as a relevant date. And no, the office of prime minister was not """"established"""" in the summer of 1990, it was merely renamed, or I should say the government was renamed, the only change instituted with the amendments was that the """"President of the Executive Council"""" now became the """"President of the Government"""".
That is purely your own judgement. The point of the matter is that democratic amendments were instituted by the Sabor (""""communist functionaries"""") before Mesic came to power. And that his position was not elective, but appointed - by Tudjman.

 Removal of image """"Robot Chemist.jpg"""" 

I have been told, and have confirmed, that you removed the image referenced above, including the link to the article """"Hans Baruch.""""

I have made several unsuccessful attempts to send email to the appropriate authorities at Wikipedia notifying them that the photograph was taken by me and that I have always considered the image to be in the public domain. The photograph was taken by me well over 40 years
ago and Research Specialties has not existed since 1965.

I hereby release all rights to this image to be used by Wikipedia for any purpose whatsoever.

I would very much appreciate it if the image were restored to the biographical article as well as the image by itself.  This photograph is an essential part of the story of the development of the Robot Chemist.

Am I doing this correctly?  If not, would you please send me the correct methodology for accomplishing the requested restoration?

Thank you for any help you can give in this matter.

Siincerely,

Hans Baruch (ex CEO of Research Specialties Company)

If I'm not mistaken, It sounds like you are telling me to piss off and go edit somewhere else. I certainly do not want to sound uncivil but don't be a Bully or a dick. Specifically which so-called unreliable source were you accusing me of using?  I have not used or added or any sources to the main entry that were not already there or that you did not restore yourself! If you say a source I used on this entry affects my credibility then you show be. Which source specifically are you referring to? Make sure you are accurate because if you are wrong WP:SPADE I will accurately call you a liar.  This is hardly constructive conversation about the entry or the subject matter it should discuss which is the actual purpose of this talk page.  

To accuse me of being a believer in this crap is offensive to me and is taken as personal attack. Now both of you doing it.  Glad I don't have to type this twice so I applies to both of you plus anyone else who wants to jump on. 
It would take a real simpleton to believe the current conspiracy but you'd be much worse off mentally if you still believed that our government plus Canada, UK, and Australia hasn't ever worked together on a series of covert projects designed to spread biological agents over a large scale (across continents) from airplanes. I hope that's not the case here.  Go ahead and call that what I just described a conspiracy. I dare you- in fact I double-dog-dare you! It is declassified and admitted and on a participating government website. I'll assume good faith, perhaps it is ignorance of the subject on your parts. It ok, I'm ignorant of a lot of wikipedia editing stuff. Belief in documented past history is the not the same as a belief in some conspiracy theory crap. Based on you comments about me, this is a concept you appear to be having trouble with. Any competent person would understand they are not the same. Is there was one available to you to explain it? I was explained to you repeatedly on this page and on my talk page. You are pretty dense of you don't have it yet.  You will find that my primary sources are 100 times more accurate than anything you'll ever find on about this fringe topic.  I am a subject matter expert on certain aspects of CBW and exposures but not on chem trails but no about to out myself to convince you.  Government declassified primary sources on WP are to be used sparingly. People like you make it difficult to talk about serious subjects. Reasonable people should not be constrained in their edits by pure ignorance unless ignorance is the consensus (TBD).  You are unable to consider ever it which speaks to your credibility. I've never seen anything like it except with the Japanese.  They never learned any thing negative about their national history in school and rarely consider that conflicting with their established beliefs. Department of National Defence (Canada), Biological Warfare Talk to me once you Understand its significance. It is 245 whole pages of you and your poor attitude being epically wrong. Tell me or tell all of us about how its not true.  Next as a recently uncovered case Associated Press. Planes covertly dropping chemicals on kids?  Want the whole report?  See the Lawsuits over it? That should get you and people like you somewhere near the truth someday but my guess is for people like you it never will...  Bad sources that don't back my viewpoint? Hardly. Check your own lack of sources. Where the source you just referred to? both of need to answer this. You've made an accusation me about my sources back it up!",1

This is ridiculous.
Aside from the reference not actually calling it a war crime, saying that """"some"""" characterize it as one doesn't make it one.
War crimes are serious violations of the laws of war.  The key words here are """"laws"""" and """"war.""""  Unless one lives in a corrupt town, laws are made by legislatures, or in this case ratified by them, after being written and argued over by diplomats in consultation with their military's generals.  The laws of war were written with the understanding that killing large numbers of people may be a legitimate and necessary part of that process.  The laws of war were not written by corrupt and ignorant peaceniks sitting around dreaming up what they think would be moral.

 Government Opinion: Australia - wording 

Under the Government Opinion - Australia section, this phrase appears:

The unanimous opinion of that Court was that Scientology is a religion.
The cited source is http://www.austlii.edu.au//cgi-bin/disp.pl/au/cases/cth/HCA/1983/40.html?query=Church%20of%20the%20New%20Faith%20v%20Commissioner%20of%20Pay-Roll

This document states (Section 5):
The question whether Scientology is a religion cannot be answered, for there seem to be important, perhaps critically important, tenets of Scientology which the parties left without full examination. The question which can be answered is whether the beliefs, practices and observances which were established by the affidavits and oral evidence as the set of beliefs, practices and observances accepted by Scientologists are properly to be described as a religion.

My stance of being a """"Proud Nintendo 3DS Owner"""" has absolutely nothing to do with me taking a neutral position or not in the discussed article. Or can't a video game journalist for example, not have his/her personal preferences and do unbiased journalism at the same time? As for the colour code, I advise you to read the entire conversation before going in to bold assumptions. Like I said in a previous post: """"Alright, this is getting out of control. You're getting this """"Yes/No template"""" thing all wrong, seriously. Someone at my talk page said the following: """"To use an extreme example: """"Does the console kill people?"""", the answer is """"No"""", which is a positive."""". So by your philosophy would you color it with green because it's a good thing? Wrong. No, consoles do not kill people and yes, it is POSITIVE, but this does not invalidate the fact that it still is something NEGATIVE related to the question. Even the the templates themselves have by default the green color for yes and the red color for no, and that must already  mean something by itself. The purpose of Wikipedia is objectivity, not subjectivity. But what the reader does with the information is entirely up to him. Which means that if he thinks that something positive/colored green is a negative thing for him, that's his problem. He can think whatever he wants of this information. I hope this clears things up."""". To sum it up: Yes=Affirmative=Green / No=Negative=Red, personal preferences don't come into account. Again, as for the Vita issue, this has already been discussed with other editors and there has been reached a consensus in the following page: . If you're not satisfied with the consensus, feel free to discuss away. But next time, please do a little bit more research before you start pointing fingers here. Remember, we're here to help!

 """"Certaion Other Editors"""" 

 MB,
 I noted your question on SqueakBox's page and figured that I was """"certain other editors"""". I was only """"eager"""" to vote opposite because, as I would support the RFA, it seemed as though SqueakBox's jumping-the-gun needed some balance. It might have been a little POINT-y, literally copying the words and formatting and all, but that was the point of the point. How could it """"look"""" like it was live? I went to the main RfA page and his was not listed. I agree with the others that Squeak had to be watching or stalking for this so as to attack it at its earliest possibility. His """"oppose"""" was two minutes - TWO MINUTES - after the """"I accept"""" was put on the page, and as has been point out, long before it was officially live.
 Anyway, I have seen him in discussions and don't always agree with him, but I support the RfA. As for off-wiki happenings, that's part of the problem with having them... it strengthens the """"secret society"""" feeling that a lot of people seem to have (from the oft-made references to """"The Cabal"""" - something I have never made reference to).
 FWIW, I have nothing against you. I have worked hard in the past to work with SqueakBox as well, even making consessions to try and smooth things over. For my trouble, I have been blocked for making general statements while enduring pointedly direct, targeted personal attacks. Anyway, . I'm working on being less WikiDragon-ish and to stay out of WikiPolitics (at least not be involved as much as I have - less WikiStress).

Cena = Gets too much shit from people for no reason. He can't control the way he is booked. I just believe they should stop pushing him before everyone hates him way too much or just turn him heel which would work for me.

Batista = Whines too much about his position in the company and should shut his mouth. Fuck him, job him out to JBL. I use to like him but he has main evented more than Cena and is in a better position than he should be just because of Triple H.

Orton = Does whatever the fuck he wants because he is a main star and friends with Triple H. Should have been fired already for smoking pot in front of everyone. If it wasn't for Triple H, he would be jobbing in TNA right now. Fuck him, that son of a bitch does not deserve the spot he has. He is good of the mic but ring skills lack, headlock after headlock. They compare him to AJ Styles which is a joke in my opinion since AJ has pure wrestling ability.

Triple = Been playing politics for years and deserves to become a jobber for the people he has buried. He tried to keep Booker T and Kurt Angle down. Angle is one of the best wrestlers and if you watch his match with Abyss at Turning Point; which I can give you a link, it is worth the watch trust me; is still doing great things. Booker T deserved a hell of alot more than he did in WWE. I can't stand him and I hope he gets hit by a car.

Hey, Nehrams. I fixed most of the problems, with the exception of Image:DejaVuBigPoster.jpg, which some other editor got to first. However, I'm by no means a fan of arousing problems with other editors;  gave a statement I felt was valid, and you can see the problems at this location here. It was over a large section concerning a theory that involves four plotlines in the movie. I'd like you to swing by again.

Thanks, ''''''(Dime algoor see my works)",0

 A philosophical story to embrace ones mind. 

The ancient Indian mathematicians were the first to discover the digit zero """"0"""" and implement it in the formation of digits. The whole world revolves like a cycle in the form of the digit zero. The Britishers dicovered an ancient egg of Dinosaures in India. What I mean to convey is that: India is the land where Lord Rama or Lord Krishna were born. Lord Rama was an example of a perfect ideal man on earth. His life story is an example for an ideal man to follow. Lord Rama, Lord Lakshmana, Lord Bharata and Lord Shatrughana were four sons of King Dhasratha of Ayodhya. He was cursed to die from the pain of separation from his son by the blind parents of Shrawan Kumar. Kaikeyi the mother of Bharata wishes to send Lord Rama on an exile for a period of 14 years and wishes her son Bharata to be the King of Ayodhya. Lord Rama and his wife Sita and his brother Lord Lakshmana leave for forests outside the kingdom of Ayodhya. Lord Rama's brother Lord Bharata persuades lord Rama to return back but lord Rama refuses to return to Ayodhya against the wishes of his step mother Kaikeyi. But Lord Bharata returns to Ayodhya along with the sandals of lord Rama and places the sandals of his brother Lord Rama on the throne and rules the kingdom of Ayodhaya in the name of Rama. This shows the example of love between an elder brother and his younger brother. In the forest once a demon shurpanaka sister of King Ravana disuades Lord Rama to marry her, but Lord Rama tells her that he is already married and points towards his brother Lord Lakshmana who cuts off her nose and ears to show her ugly nature and character. Shurphanaka runs off and complains about Lord Rama and Lord Lakshamana to King Ravana of Lanka. King Ravana somehow manages to kidnap Goddess Sita the wife of Lord Rama in revenge to Lanka. Lord Rama grieves for his separation from his beloved wife Goddess Sita. Here the feelings of an ideal person in the form of lord grieving from separation from his beloved wife are beautifully described by Sage Valmiki who wrote the whole Ramayana. Sage Valmiki was a thief named Ratnakar who by the japam of Lord Sri Rama became a great sage named Valmiki and wrote a great epic called Ramanaya the story of King Rama and Sita. Lord Rama and Lord Lakshamana move towards southern India where they meet the lord Hanuman, (the great son of Anjani and Kesari; Lord Hanumanji is also known as Pavanputra or the great celibate bachelor) and Lord Sugriva and with the help of vanara sena or Army of Monkeys they move into the kingdom of Lanka and kill the demon king Ravana. Lord Rama rescues Goddesses Sita and with the help of Lord Hanuman they return back to Ayodhya. A fourteen years had lapsed when lord Rama had left the kingdom of Ayodhya. When lord Rama, Goddesses Sita, Lord Lakshmana and lord Hanuman return to Ayodhya, the people of Ayodhya cheer up and lit up the whole Ayodhya with Diyas in order to celebrate the victory and return of their king Lord Rama. The festival Dusherra is celebrated every year as a victory of good over evil as the demon Meghanad {the son of King Ravana},the demon Kumbhakarna {the brother of king Ravana} and the demon King Ravana of Lanka were killed by Lord Rama and Lord Lakshmana in order to rescue Goddesses Sita from her captivity in Lanka. And on the occassion of their return to Ayodhya the festival Diwali is celebrated throughout India every year with  great pomp and show of lights and crackers. Whenever some troubled minds read this story of Ramayana their minds gain peace and the self confidence is restored as their spirits become calm, pacified and brave in the troubled periods of time. The Epic Ramayana denotes the greatness of Supreme God Lord Rama as an ideal human being on earth.  """,0

I just noticed the similarity, though I read in that book I told you about, Historic Salem: an Inventory of Historic Places (1987), that the station was built on a template and there are a few just like it still scattered around the country. I didn't find any architect info on the library, but I would assume it was built to a standard plan as well...

It was great to finally meet you! I suggested to Pete that sometime we try to have a clandestine Wikimeetup for lunch at the Rachel Ray-approved Goudy Commons sometime.

So you know that the """"Boundless"""" UO architecture site is totally awesome, despite their trying to spam everything in creation with links to it. Would you be interested in making a template and vetting the link through a WikiProject, maybe ours and the also the architecture project? ? 

P.S. Yeah, The Oregonian should at least acknowledge that they are using free images from Wikipedia! The rats.

How would a valid criticism of actions be presented if using an adjective such as """"pompous"""" is not allowed? I feel like I have to point out here that name-calling is by definition ascribing a noun to an individual, such as assclown, doofus, idiot, choadlicker, and on.

You're actually working against everything that is good about wikipedia, systematically going after people and questioning everything they do. Who told you to do this? Why take the 'law' into your own hands? Ask yourself this: who are you protecting? You wanna play cops and robbers, go and joing the freaking police. Do something useful, rather than wasting your life on here. What is your job? Cos this ain't real life buddy, and if its your only hobby, I feel bad for you. I mean really bad.
